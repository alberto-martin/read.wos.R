A quantitative analysis	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						publicly available thesauri; Internet; evaluation		This work offers a quantitative analysis of publicly available thesauri in different European languages in order to check publication trends and their degree of adherence to thesauri construction guidelines. The following parameters were analysed: publisher's name and location, number of terms, subject coverage, query modes, latest update, level of content in introduction and on-line help. The results reveal the prevalence of thesauri published in Western Europe; English is the most frequently used language, social sciences have the highest number of thesauri among the knowledge areas observed; only one third of the thesauri has a search engine; on average, there is a poor level of content in the introductions and in the on-line help. In conclusion, many publicly available thesauri do not take advantage offered by the Internet for querying their content and should improve their interfaces.

Network cooperation at the local, regional, national and international level is essential to achieve this goal. The Ministry of Culture's library policy in recent years has allowed for the creation of the needed cooperation structures so that all administrations and all types of libraries can collaborate together in projects and initiatives targeted at the joint development of their networks and systems, which provides for the acknowledgement of libraries as key democratic institutions in education, cultural, social and research and development policies.

Its integrated character allows it to become a platform of convergence for libraries with an educational function in order to effectively administer and manage information services, contents and library human resources. Considering the principal models of joint-use libraries, we pay special attention to the Australian case for its leadership in the topic and its contribution to information literacy. Experience, progress and, even more, the opportunities that the model offers in Spain are analyzed through a SWOT matrix. Finally, we propose a model programme on information literacy for joint-use libraries, developed by the authors fur Baratz Servicios de Teledocumentacion S.

A model was designed with indicators to examine the topics, configuration and informative value of the galleries. The study included the quantitative importance of the galleries, their increasing specialization and heterogeneous design, access and functionality. The conclusions are: the galleries are abundant, have good visibility and present a great variety of themes. The lack of standardized labeling of links, redundant access and little magnification of the images are significant drawbacks. There should be more informative contextualization of the photos, enhancing the hypertext linkage between the galleries and information pages to which they refer.			joaquin.lopezdelramo@urjc.es						8	2	2	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inf.

This is possible due to the virtual health library "history and cultural heritage of health" that is based on technical cooperation to support information sources that are treated as public resources.

Undoubtably, cooperation between libraries optimizes resources, which in developing countries are more than scarce. But along with this reality, another one is rediscovered: the force and originality of working in a network. The concept of cooperation between libraries comprises a range of more and less complex variables. Some forms of cooperation require constant feedback to enjoy good health, others only need pre-established agreements that offer a legitimate framework for certain daily activities. The first relies on interpersonal contact, the latter on contractual compliance by participating institutions. Time power and creativity of the early networks is discussed, beginning with conceptual questions and then the policies and working arrangements of the National Library of Argentina with respect to cooperation. The genesis of the "Library on rails" project is presented, with special emphasis on one of the project's activities: regional meetings of the participating librarians.

Libraries constitute a network that supports both developing and developed countries and assures respect for fairness, the general quality of life for all people and the environment. At present, we see how the society has changed from manufacturing to the provision of services, and later to an economy based on knowledge.

As the amount of information around us is still growing, IA continues to innovate with new forms of organization, more efficient search engines and Semantic Web technologies that let computers take care of the less creative part of coping with the avalanche of information.

Participants (n=58) attempted informational, navigational, transactional or multimedia tasks. Sessions were recorded with an eye tracker to determine whether the intention behind queries affects the way people browse the results page. Eye fixations in title, snippet, url and images were analyzed in the three first organic and sponsored results. In general terms, the results demonstrate that a relationship exists between the users' intention and their behavior when they browse the results page. Knowing this behavior is important for search engine designers because they can improve their results pages depending on the users' query intentions.

Evaluating the Information Architecture in an already deployed website is not an easy task. Most evaluation techniques cure focused on examining system usability, but this is not the only factor that influences IA. The main technique that deals with IA in already deployed web environments is the Navigation Stress Test (NST). A new methodology makes this technique more informative by taking NST beyond simple notation on paper. This work proposes the use of NST combined with other usability testing techniques such as Thinking Aloud and a usability questionnaire. Eye tracking also has been used to supplement the information obtained from applied techniques. This new methodology has been tested by analyzing a series of websites belonging to Spanish public university libraries. The results of this study show the validity of the approach used, as well as the value that this approach and the use of Eye tracking bring to the analysis of IA compare to traditional NST.

Along with usage metrics such as downloads there are many measures that are generated from Science 2.0. Journals published by the Public Library of Science systematically collect many of these new metrics. The objective of this paper is to present some of these new indicators and analyze them quantitatively through the case study of 8945 papers published in the journal PLoS One. The selected indicators were; comments, ratings, number of bookmarks, links from scientific weblogs, downloads views and citations. Basic descriptive statistics indicators and correlations have been calculated for all of them. The results show the low participation of scientists in Web 2.0 and how most of these indicators, except for downloads and visits, are poorly consolidated metrics.

But the analysis of different levels of internationality of publications is a complex task, particularly in the Humanities. This paper attempts to make a small contribution toward clarifying some of the methodological difficulties encountered. After a brief review of indicators on journal internationality employed in a number of papers published between 1997 and 2007, the authors selected several that were among the most frequently used and least controversial. The indicators were then applied to Spanish scholarly journals to assess their internationality through the following parameters: internationality of advisory boards, internationality of contributing authors and international visibility. The results obtained in this exercise are presented and in the discussion they are compared with the categorization assigned to the same journals in the ERIH "Initial lists". Possible reasons for the major discrepancies observed are analyzed. The conclusions point to the urgent need to clarify the applied indicators to determine internationality, to expand their number and to assure their objectivity, in order to guarantee the reproducibility of the assessment process and results.

The great majority of Spanish language journals are official publications of Spanish medical societies which represent for their members an important channel for scholarly communication. The Spanish language journals revealed a notable number of Spanish research groups (n = 525), 85.8% of published papers caine from health care institutions, and the prevalent type of collaboration was domestic and regional. Furthermore, the study reveals that higher levels of citation are associated with papers published by the aforementioned research groups, those having a greater degree of collaboration, and those that had at least one woman participating. On the other hand, English language journals are focused on basic research and only publish articles or reviews. Their productivity rate is lower; but they have a higher level of international participation and outstanding citation rates. 87.62% of papers from these journals were published by researchers from academic institutions. Collaboration on the international level ranges between 16% and 22% of the total.

However, empirical knowledge about international research visits is very limited due to an overall lack of data in most countries. In this paper we use curriculum vitae data contained in the Scientific Information System of Andalusia to study the dynamics of the temporary mobility of Andalusian researchers. We analyse a population of more than 6,000 mobile researchers and almost 18,000 international research visits, over the period 1961-2009. The analysis reveals significant changes over time in the frequency, duration, geographical destination and gender distribution of visits. It also shows important differences in temporary mobility patterns among research disciplines.

To implement this change, it is imperative to combine the existing information systems of different health areas that perform in isolation. Although the Spanish government has launched an online health project to achieve this goal, there are still difficulties due to the lack of resources and infrastructure and a few barriers between the Spanish. autonomous communities that must be overcome.

The main characteristics are the high rates of synonymy and homonymy, due to phenomena such as the pro-liferation of polysemic acronyms and their interaction with common language. Information retrieval systems in the biomedical domain use techniques oriented to the treatment of these lexical peculiarities. In this paper we review some of these techniques, such as the application of Natural Language Processing (BioNLP), the incorporation of lexical-semantic resources, and the application of Named Entity Recognition (BioNER). Finally, we present the evaluation methods adopted to assess the suitability of these techniques for retrieving biomedical resources.

Two sets of journals are studied: 63 journals in which the impact factor increased after four successive decreases and 23 journals in which the impact factor increased in at least six successive years during the period studied. The main variable is the percentage of journal self citations that contribute to impact factor No proof was found of widespread manipulation of the impact factor as a result of the high level of use of self citations in journals.

Prospective archival science: new issues and methods for archival research	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						Archival science; prospective archival science; archival research; prospective analysis; consensus techniques; monitoring; technological monitoring		Archival science, which is highly influenced by social and technological change, is presently in the midst of a profound transformation that affects its very nature. After a brief introduction to future studies, prospective archival science is defined as the research posed and conducted to respond to queries and uncertainties respecting the future of archives and archival science, as well as the study of factors of change that will determine that future. This is followed by a reflection on the fundamentals of this discipline, the questions to be addressed, the fields of application, and the most suitable methods. The article concludes with a proposal fir the appropriate application of prospective archival science: consensus documents and indicators.

This is mainly due to its simplicity, since it is a single indicator that combines production and impact, and can easily be determined by any researcher It also eliminates the bias caused by the long tail of citation distribution. However, this indicator has limitations, in that it jails to discriminate between researchers with different publishing habits and, as a result, it penalizes those with a more selective output characterized by a relatively low number of frequently cited documents, as opposed to authors with a high number of publications. This paper proposes a solution that would take into consideration the citations of those publications with a high probability of increasing the future h index values.

Additionally, the article proposes two indicators for understanding the importance of a web domain: the Relative representativeness size factor (Rs) and the Relative representativeness visibility factor (Rv). These indicators, which consider the number of both documents and links, respectively, during a specific interval of time are intended to be applied in the design and construction of university rankings based on cybermetric techniques. The results confirm that the size differences among academic web domains vary significantly depending on the search engine used; therefore the use of a single web browser cannot supply reliable information about the actual size of the web domain. Moreover, the use of combined values from the mean obtained from each search engine does not offer reliable results. given the variance of data obtained from the different search engines, as well as the index differences of Rs. The differences concerning visibility were smaller, but significant nonetheless. Rs and Rv indicators were found to provide useful and consistent information about the level of development of universities on the Web during a given time interval. There was also a positive correlation between these two indicators on both Yahoo! and Exalead, confirming the relationship between the number of documents of an academic web domain and the number of links it receives over time.

It presents a structural analysis of the collaboration network among the different organizations that participate in these projects, as well as a description of the degree of participation and of the results obtained, on a regional, sectorial, and individual basis. The results show that Spanish participation lies primarily with the governmental sector, especially on a national level, with the principal involvement concentrated in CSIC, CNIO, hospitals, and universities. The article concludes that Spain is on the periphery of the health-related thematic area, with participation largely undertaken by CSIC.

Attention to corporate image is essential for midsize organizations that have not yet understood or are just beginning to understand that tangible differentiation is not enough to establish competitive advantages in an increasingly globalized market. This paper addresses the value-added importance that documentation has (or should have) as companies manage their intangible assets, especially the corporate image. It also discusses the importance of organizations assuming documentation as part of managing their work. In particular, we focus on the role of documentation in the "assessment" of the image through the image audit. This first phase is completed with the "management" phase, including development of a series of documents, programs and manuals that require a significant review effort so that in the long term the organization can obtain benefits in terms of added value.

This reality contrasts with the trends of the specialized literature, which show patents to be one of the most important parameters to measure scientific productivity Therefore, we conducted a case study on the patents registered by Spanish Universities in 2008, using as our source the European Patents Fulltext database. Analysis of the distribution of patents by university in this specific period of time revealed a certain correlation with other commonly used indicators.

A brief study is made of advertising documentation in Spain from the theoretical and practical points of view. Then, the models for document management used in the agencies are studied and explained, and a definition of what is understood to be advertising documentation is drawn up. In addition, the documentary elements that should be used in the advertising campaigns and in the proper functioning of the documentation centres are proposed.

However Thomson has recently included in the Journal Citation Reports the Eigen factor and the Article influence score. On the other hand Elsevier has included in Scopus the Source normalized impact per paper (SNIP) and the SCImago journal rank (SJR). In this paper we introduce, and describe these indicators. Secondly to study the similarities we analyze correlations of the traditional indicators and the new ones, detailing the results across 27 scientific fields. It was noted that some couples of indicators such as Eigen Citations, Impact factor-ArticleScore, Impact factor SJR and SJR-ArticleScore do correlate in many areas. Correlations showed different trends in Science and Social science; therefore, in the last section we discuss the need to take into account the scientific area when selecting an indicator.

More marketing should be done, thus making more people aware of it. MARC became obsolete and has to be superseded by xml-based standards. With the advent of Google, people don't have any problems finding information. Instead they have problems knowing what to do with once they acquire it. A next generation library catalog should allow people to first find items in a library collection, and then to use the information in some way. Public libraries are devoted to their community. If they focus too much on books, then their future is less positive. If they think in terms of data, information, and knowledge, their future is only as limited as their imagination.

The authors invite a rethinking of paradigm tools that prevail in libraries. The study also aims to discuss the old paradigms as opposed to the changes that are taking place and focuses on defining a model of innovative thinking which can sustain the e-evolution" of libraries. Analyzing the perspectives from a qualitative research method founded on the triangulation of three or more different perspectives, the methodology-driven approach defines the paradigm changes that will be more influential in. the near future and hence poses new ways to think about the interrelationship between different actors that will positively affect a sustainable e-evolution" of libraries if they are considered and seen from a global human-centered point of view.

This proposal is here validated via a case stucdy. Collected data were processed employing an in-house tool designed for use in patentometric studies. Latin American. technological knowledge published in the USA between September 7996 and April 1997 was examined, paying special attention to that of Brazil, The largest Latin American filer of patents. The set of patentometric indicators. proposed allows one to quantify and qualify the behaviour of technological production in terms of the patents granted. Using The patents analysed, the technological capacity revealed in the different technical areas covered is represented, along with The ranking of institutes, research centres and industries, etc. The productivity of their principal technologists and their relationships is also shown. The latter element of analysis favours cooperation and technological exchange, as well as the identification of priorities and opportunities. The above information is an aid for the planning, implementation and assessment of research and technological development policies at any level. This kind of analysis is considered an indispensable tool for improving our knowledge of regional technological resources. It also encourages the better use of existing technological capacities.

It also examines the main research groups and disciplines of the multidisciplinary PASS field. The frequency and percentage of jointly authored articles, and the number of authors per paper, were analysed. Cooperative network analysis was performed for the most productive authors to identify research groups, and the group density was calculated to reveal group cohesion. Production. was also analysed by discipline. Single-authored publications were fewer than co-authored publications in most of the journals and disciplines examined. The average number of authors per article was 2.5. Fifteen research groups were identified, the lager ones being The most productive and less cohesive. Cooperation with foreign researchers was modest and mostly limited to South American authors. Teaching and training theory were the most productive disciplines. The results highlight The trend towards cooperation that has been observed over recent years, in PASS, but cooperation in terms of the number of co-authors per article remains rather low, as does the number of research groups identified.

Putting the reference service in place in this new environment requires redesigning the policies, procedures and resources applied to it and therefore an analysis of the services and functions of the computing tools available must be undertaken. Integrated library management systems which involve multiple functionalities for delivering services, or which expand the capacity for their delivery, must also respond to the requirements for putting this type of service in place. This article sets out the results obtained in a study carried out on several examples of integrating new reference services into a library, management system (Koha), which not only enables these services to be delivered but also expands the options for using the data for their improvement and development.

Aware of this gap, Elsevier has launched Scival. It is a web platform intended to assess institutions through maps and indicators calculated from the Scopus database. In this article we review this new product. We first describe the scientific basis of the platform that is based on the works of Klavan and Bojack about co-citation maps of science and the identification of paradigms. Secondly we describe its interface and its utilities, paying particular attention to the so-called Wheel of science. Finally, we discuss some critical aspects of Scival.

Making use of experience with, IraLIS (International Registry for Authors: Library and Information Science = Link, to Identify Scientists; http://www.iralis.org), this study examines how authorities are registered in two Spanish, OAI-PMH-compliant projects: Recercat and E-Prints Complutense. The authorities database of the two repositories analysed were downloaded. The style of signing - the recommended one should contain only two elements - was recorded by field of knowledge, using the topic classification systems of The Intute project and The ANEP agency. The most commonly used signing style involved two surnames (76% in Recercat and 94% in E-Prints Complutense). The social sciences showed the greatest adoption of the recommended signing style (20% of all records in this area). The adoption rate of the recommended signing style in both, repositories was low, especially in E-Prints Complutense. The index of the use of The recommended signing style by knowledge field reveals a true picture of these Open Access repositories. This information could allow awareness campaigns to be designed for different fields of knowledge. it might be thought that the most internationalised sciences and the authors of its literature would take signing style into account, but this does not seem to be the case. Indeed, The social sciences were those which most frequently followed the recommended system. The areas of technology, health and lift sciences, the arts and humanities should be the subjects of awareness campaigns, Further work should study the possible differences in the use of signing style depending on who inputs information into databases.

This paper describes and analyses the characteristics of the instructional materials created by Spanish academic libraries. It evaluates a sample of 72 resources in public access by applying 36 indicators grouped in ten categories. Only 24% of libraries were found to have created such materials, focusing on explaining the sources of information and library services. Only three produced materials addressing information literacy. In general, these instructional materials were of poor quality from an educational point of view, (few educational objectives, few exercises to reinforce learning, few Pre-tests, and little final assessment) and commonly were little interactive (50% involved slides and 20% pdfs). In conclusion, most of these teaching materials appeared to be at an early stage of development and did not allow the user to either completely or autonomously follow the learning process.

The role of typographic elements in the configuration of messages is discussed, as is multimodality or the coexistence of different modes within the same document, and the interaction of prose and images. The need to conceive textual documents as part of a dynamic process of consumption that includes document readers with, all their expectations, knowledge and experiences is underscored. We argue that a different understanding of textual documents can have important implications for documentation science, especially with regard to the modes of interaction between document and documentation professional.

Science evolves socially through physical records and information media, whose changes influence both science and society Information professionals have been managing these physical records or knowledge containers. The technodigital revolution grows an industrialized information society where science is a productive workforce, with a neurodigital nature, and develops as a collective enterprise. Science containers are now very changeable, plural, segmented, networking, and take on a business look: they become "specific information platforms".

For this reason, several studies have attempted to evaluate its capacity as a bibliometric tool. Due to this interest, we present an introduction to its use and the advantages and disadvantages versus Scopus and Web of Science. First, its way of collecting information and features of its interface are analyzed. The following section describes the results that Google Scholar generates. Thirdly, we analyze the coverage of information sources and the different document types to be found, showing how this coverage universe offers different citations versus other products. Finally, we specify the standardization problems of Google Scholar and offer a number of precautions that must be taken into account when. using Google Scholar as an evaluation tool.

In. this context the objective of this paper is to illustrate how we call strategically use Web Services 2.0 to disseminate and give greater visibility to scientific publications. To this end we present a series of services of interest to scientific communication (Blogger, Twitter, Facebook, Slideshare y E-Lis) and explain the role they can play in communicating scientific results. It also shows how these services should be logically interrelated, which we call the strategic dissemination cycle. In the last section, the authors collected a set of webmetric indicators classified into three groups (social influence, use, recognition) to evaluate the success of the dissemination strategy and the visibility of a work in the Web 2.0.

This work tries to compile a more complete, global and integrated study of that type of management strategies. Our study offers an analytical model of the informational behaviour of a group of individuals (students of an e-learning university, UOC) who have a positive perception of the information and communication technologies and use them intensively in their academic, professional and everyday contexts. From this qualitative research (24 interviews and content analysis), four user profiles (reactive, passive, comprehensive and proactive) have been identified in relation to personal information management and its relevant variable: access, management and use of information, cognitive style, attitude, information-related competencies, ICT perception, and academic, professional and everyday contexts. These profiles show the differences in information behave for each context (daily life, professional and academic). Identification of the use profiles was the essential first step in a use centered service design that addresses the specific intervention/contribution appropriate to each use type, taking into account tool and process requirement needed for them to develop efficient information behaviours.

Factors determining whether these opportunities may be profited from are: access to information and the cognitive approach of the decision-making agent, named); the manager In our research we explore which sources of information provide the stimuli impacting the decision to internationalize and assess the influence of Management's cognitive approach. To achieve this we conducted a survey, amongst Spanish firms in the region of Castilla and Leon in two specific areas: "information technologies" and "natural stone". Informative stimuli are split into three concepts (appealing factors, barriers and support) and we draw on several sources of information (Icex, Excal, Chambers of Commerce and trade associations). We address two cognitive areas: proactivity and level of knowledge. Findings high-light the relative importance of the different sources of information explored in the analysis. Our research also evidences how the information received by managers merges with their own cognitive approaches forming the basis to assess the factors impacting the decision to internationalize.

Materials science has existed since the earliest civilizations. The development and evolution of societies has been intimately linked to The ability of their members to produce and shape materials to meet their needs. However, materials; science has only recently been established as a recognised academic discipline, a consequence of the agglomeration of different areas of science. The citation habits and scientograms associated with this field could therefore be related to the scientific tradition and culture of each country. In this study, the citation networks of six of the most developed countries in the year 2002 were examined using a new technique That graphically represents these networks as scientograms. The technique makes use of cocitation between topic categories of the JCR to generate a network of categories which is graphically represented. The scientograms obtained, which represent the citation networks of each country examined, reflect the cultures of the different nations studied.

The major role of central regions: the case of Madrid	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						Web of Science; regional collaboration; Madrid; network analysis	INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION; CO-AUTHORSHIP; SCIENCE; INDICATORS; CITATIONS	In recent years there has been an increasing trend towards the decentralization of Spanish scientific production, with Madrid gradually losing its dominant role. To examine this process, the present study raises a series of questions, such as which regions are most increasing their scientific outputs and what is the importance of cooperation with Madrid in this growth? Whether collaboration with Madrid contributes towards improving the impact and visibility of publications is also examined. To answer these questions, Spanish scientific production was analysed using the Web of Science international databases (period 2001-2005). The results show that the Valencia and Andalusia regions arc, those which have most increased their scientific production, but proportionally the most exceptional growth was achieved in Castilla-La Mancha. Although collaboration with Madrid is very significant, Catalonia is also an important region in this respect. However, cooperation with Madrid especially improved the impact and visibility of publications in the area of clinical medicine, and this region continues to be an important centre of scientific development, the support of which is vital to the growth of output in the smallest regions of Spain.

The topological characteristics of this network are described, and the web relationships among the universities of different countries and continents are examined. The top 350 institutions of higher education of Iberoamerica were selected from the Ranking Web of World Universities and Their link relationships obtained from Yahoo! Search. Network graphs and geographical maps were constructed from the search engine data. Social network analysis techniques were used to analyse and describe the structural properties of the network and its nodes. The results show that the Iberoamerican network is composed of national sub-networks that merge to form a central core. The Spanish language sub-network dominates the Iberoamerican network, which is split into two linguistic regions: Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal) and Spanish (the remaining countries).

On the positive side, in 2006 more use of alternatives to graphics was made, cascading style sheets and the use of Flash and PDF. In addition, more universities (10 in total) complied 100% with the WCAG at level A. On the negative side, the texts were of poorer quality than in 2001, and fewer complied with accessibility standards with respect to plans of study, which were usually automatically generated. An analysis was also made of the compliance of indicators with American standard 508 (which is not mandatory in Spain) and five other usability indicators. No university complied 100 916 with standard 508; compliance with the other indicators was 65%. The results show that the level of accessibility remains low, similar in fact to the situation in 2001, but with large differences between universities. Indeed the level of compliance is less lban that which might be expected given the changes in Spanish law made to favour access to public web sites.

They assist decision-makers in distributing resources appropriately, in the awarding of funding, in the management of research groups and projects, and via the identification of capacities and weaknesses, better orientate research. These indicators are widely used, following internationally accepted methodologies that have been developed since the 1930s and adapted to the needs of different times. However the relationship between engineering technology and economic activity has insufficient indicators and there is a lack of methodologies for investigating it; the accurate assessment of the social, educational, cultural, environmental and commercial impact(s) of engineering projects is very difficult. With the aim of being able to determine the impact of research and technological development, this work discusses the main advances made in The use of S&T indicators. Emphasis is placed on the need to develop new methodologies for assessing the socioeconomic impact of science and technology, particularly from the perspective of Latin American countries.

The aim of this study is to identify key indicators for the evaluation of digital press archives and also identify examples of good practices in Spain for each of them. We propose a list of twenty-seven indicators grouped into four main sections (general features, contents, query system, and presentation of results), describe each one and include some examples of succesful implementation. Methodologically, the indicators are the result of the review of the literature on evaluating web resources, databases and digital press archives, as well as the analysis of press archive services of newspapers from Spain and Catalonia. The use of these indicators can be useful for libraries and other information services to guide their users in consulting retrospective press information.

Using the same concepts and analytic tools developed for the traditional press in the evaluation of cyberjournalism leads to the undervaluation of specific characteristics of journalistic products designed for the new medium. On the other hand, analytic tools used for website evaluation are generally too generic and ill adapted for the specificities of cyberjournalism. In this article we explore some of the difficulties involved in quality assessment of online journalism. The difficulties in analyzing memory in cyberjournalism is used to indicate some of the challenges posed for the webnewspaper analyst.

The imminent commercialisation of new mobile devices using e-ink, licensed by Philips, and especially the new model of Sony's Portable Reader System in Spain (announced for Spring 2009), a determined commercial strategy, and incipient research by some Spanish newspapers make us wonder whether we are facing the end of the printed press. At the moment, the new devices are much better than their predecessors, but enough problems remain to make its doubt that we are at the beginning of the end of newsprint. The strengths of some other devices that differ from the e-book bill could eventually be able to present books or newspaper on their screens, such as iPhone-like cell phones or Amazon's Kindle (not yet available in Spain) opens an interesting era of competition and convergence.

This paper extends the analysis to public research organisations (PRO). From both a historic and economic standpoint, and via the interpretation of three institutional factors (the change in The political and legal background, the dominance of certain areas of science over others, and the increase in technological cooperation), the reasons moving The Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC; the Spanish Research Council) to file patents were examined. The impact of these quantified factors on patenting was examined from 1987 to the present. The institutional framework of bodies such as the CSIC was found to favour a patenting culture. The historical approach adopted defined homogeneous analytical periods and guided the interpretation of the results and their effects over time, while the economic approach allowed some of the relationships seen to be quantified and questioned the validity of merely descriptive classifications (e.g., scientific areas according to number of patents).

The results reveal the existence of two main clusters, one formed by the Psychology and the Education and other with a prominent location of the Economics and The Political Science; Sociology is The main connexion between the two clusters. The journals with the highest rate of betweeness were Revista de Educacion and Papeles de Economia. The Library and Information Science appears in a marginal side of the different maps. Revista Espanola de Documentacion Cientifica is the most relevant journal with the large: betweeness rate due to its significant relationships with international journals. The results show that IN-RECS is a useful tool for the structural study of the Spanish Social Sciences.

The web visibility of the works published by the university scholars was examined, and a comparison made of the observed gender pattern with, that apparent in bibliometric studies. The publications of 289 of the university's associate professors That appeared in 2006 were examined, as was their possession -or not- of a personal Web page, and whether the academic repository of the university (Complutense F Prints) Contained at least one of their works. The number of scholars with a personal page was very low; those of the Social Sciences and Humanities were better represented. Women scholars were more poorly represented than men in this respect. Also, the amount of work?, deposited in the E-Prints repository was found to be very low. No differences were seen between men and women with respect to visibility.

J	Aranda, MM				Mitre Aranda, Maria			TESQUAL: A microthesaurus for use in quality management in European Higher Education	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						University quality; European Higher Education Area; microthesaurus; Tesqual		The demand for quality has become a major concern in. university education. The widespread implantation of quality assessment systems suggests the need for persons working in this area to have a standardised 'language' at their disposal. The use of controlled vocabularies for standardising terms and aiding access to information may be beneficial in this respect, This might help solve a growing problem in the field of quality assessment and management in higher education: terminological dispersion and the scant control of specialized vocabulary. The final aim of this work is the production of a documental tool for solving the problems arising from the representation of information and its recovery, and which improves the processing and transfer of specialized information. The present objective was to integrate the needs and expectations of different stakeholders by developing a microthesaurus for experts working in assessment and quality in higher education.

Here, the different elements, procedures and principles which make tip the Wikipedia authority control system is analysed, and a critical analogy is traced between them and those that meet the traditional authority control applied to bibliographical catalogues. From the critical comparison of both models, one wonders up to what point the authority control, constrained by the weight of tradition and by its hopeless adaptation to technology, has been surpassed by developments such as Wikipedia which are based on a philosophy of flexibility and common sense and where the rules are decided by and for the user The enormous potential and reach of the Wikipedia authority model make it a true contender to become the normal system of access to the Semantic Web.

Its use within organizations follows this general trend and a large portion of a company's internal information flow occurs in this way. Thus, monitoring its use, while preserving the anonymity of its users, is a very valuable tool to know the informal structure of an organization and to compare it with the prescribed formal structure.

In addition, the nature of web content is semantically heterogeneous and oriented to people who will be able to understand it. Frequently the results from search engines do not correspond to the expected topic. One approach to improve the results is to match the content of the web pages with a formal vocabulary on the topic (ontology) and with the informal vocabulary (common terms of the topic but not in the ontology). This paper describes a web search method that takes advantage of ontologies to reduce the search area of certain topics. With this approach the relevance of search engine results is enhanced by filtering the content through the integration of domain ontologies, the WordNet thesaurus, and a hierarchical similarity Measure. Thus, the improvement on the relevance of results reduces the time required to review such results.

These packages can create bibliography and footnotes in combination with popular word processing programs. They also allow direct searching in some data bases and sharing of bibliographic files among research colleagues. However as search results become more and more numerous, conventional treatment of reference lists presents some difficulties to scientific information users. Along with other applications designed to visualize search results, RefViz is more a data visualization and analysis software than a bibliographic management package. Nevertheless, its use in combination with other reference managers can give users a powerful tool to explore a large amount of collected references based on their content.

The aim of the study is to know how the network evolves, what is its shape, what groups are detected and what uses are carried out within the network. We identified 663 Flickr members through a double snowball process and harvested their joining date, photos and contacts with a crawler The results show that the users who joined Flickr in 2004 use the set-vice as a communication medium among amateur photographers, while the subsequent members utilise Flickr as a real social network, using the photos as a way to express personal experiences, opinions and tastes.

Rather stable patterns are required before the mental map enables a user to make inferences over time. In order to enhance stability developed an extension of stress minimization with developments over time. This dynamic layouter is no longer based on linear interpolation between independent static visualizations, but change over time is used as a parameter in the optimization. Because of our focus on structural change versus stability the attention is shifted from the relational graph to the latent eigenvectors of matrices. The approach is illustrated with animations for the journal citation environments of Social networks, the (co)author networks in the carrying community of this journal, and the topical development using relations among its title words. Our results are also compared with animations based on PajekToSVGAnim and SoNIA.

The visual interfaces can help with retrieval. This paper explores the combination of co-term analysis techniques with social networks for the generation of subject maps of collections. The main conclusion is that the methodology applied is valid, and that the maps could be used for browsing and subject retrieval. It would also be useful for improving the quality of indexing.

The expectations for job access of these graduates have been fulfilled in most of the cases, and they spent all average of thirteen months looking for a job. A great part of these workers are employed in specific functions of Information Science. Nevertheless, most of them don't belong to any Professional Association of Information Sciences. In spite of this, we can conclude that these studies must be better known in order to show everybody what opportunities are available to these professionals.

Fortunately, this trend is changing, inasmuch as network theory and analyst's may mean a quantitative and qualitative leap forward in the representation and analysis of the structure of all types of scientific domains, whether geographic, thematic or institutional. The extraordinary advances that have taken place in recent years in the study and analysis of complex networks have been made possible by a number of parallel developments. First of all, with computerized data acquisition and handling, large databases can be managed, leading to the emergence of different real network topologies. Secondly the increase in computing power has made it possible to explore networks with millions of nodes. Thirdly, there is the scow but sure breakdown of boundaries between disciplines. This can be seen by researchers because of their ability to access and use databases that facilitate an understanding of the generic properties of complex networks.

It records the appearance, and development of GMD in the AACR code and ISBD standards. The problems arising in the interpretation and use of GMD, especially the lack of a formal definition of the class of material concept, the emergence of multiple characteristic resources, and terminological confusion are also analysed. The factors affecting the present transformation of GMD within the context of the revision of AACR2 and the appearance of the FRBR conceptual model are reviewed. Finally, current initiatives related to the redefinition of GMD and its adaptation to the digital environment, undertaken by the IFLA, IME-ICC and JSC (the last of these being responsible for the RDA-Resource Description and Access standard), are presented.

The two most widely used formats for the publication of scientific articles in digital format, HTML and PDF, are analysed, examining reader performance in relation to the presence of contents lists or internal or linked tables. The study involved two groups: 30 blind subjects, all JAWS users, contacted through the ONCE Foundation, and 30 sighted subjects, lecturers in the Department of Librarianship and Documentation of the University of Barcelona. The results shows the location of data in tables is easier in HTML documents through the inclusion of a contents list linked to these tables. Further, the inclusion of complete tables in the body of HTML document facilitates the reading activity of blind users. At the methodological level, this work reports two novelties with respect to the existing literature on usability by blind people: it examines the usability of the PDF format, and discusses a quantitative usability test. The latter hinders comparison with the majority of published articles.

Scientific activity, visibility, impact, research potential, citations, self-citations, regional and international collaboration indices are provided for each university. The empirical evidence shows a stratified university system exists, with no clear specializations in research activity. A diagram is presented to show the collaboration of Catalan universities with international institutions. As a whole, they prefer to collaborate with institutions in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, and obtain better visibility when publishing with English-speaking authors.

The subjects of this study were the websites produced by the Town Councils of Spain's provincial capitals as well as those of the autonomous cities Ceuta and Melilla. Their content and the personnel in charge of their creation, development, maintenance and updating were all examined. A questionnaire was designed to study the content of and the services offered by these websites; information was recorded by direct observation. The persons charged with the technical and content management of these sites were identified by a multiple choice-type questionnaire sent by e-mail and fax to those responsible for these new services. Thirty three of the 52 councils contacted responded. The results show that at the municipal level Spain is still in the phase of making information available, with some local governments moving faster than others towards an 'electronic administration'. Nonetheless, the country is still far from working by 'electronic government'.

Indicators of scientific activity were determined, including number of publications, author productivity, and collaborations. In addition, the percentages of works in the different majority languages (French, Latin, Italian, English and German) were calculated. The results show that: a) the growth of the number of works in the analysed period was exponential; b) author productivity did not follow Lotka's law; c) the number of signing authors per work is very low (index 1.1); c) French retained its linguistic hegemony for almost the entire period examined (1629-1885); d) Latin, which was very powerfully represented until the end of the 18(th) century, disappeared in the 19(th) century, coinciding with the spectacular growth of English and German. The change in the languages employed in these works is analysed with respect to the historical contexts of the corresponding countries.			malena.5@hotmail.com; jjsolaz@valencia.uned.es						13	1	2	CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS	MADRID	VITRUVIO 8, 28006 MADRID, SPAIN	0210-0614			REV ESP DOC CIENT	Rev.

To do this, rss feeds are used as "current awareness bulletins" to generate personalized bibliographic alerts. The SDI service model has an rss feeds management module and an information push module. In the first module, resources are represented as rss feed items and are also semi-automatically assigned subject terms by matching their associated keywords against the terms of a SKOS Core format thesaurus. In the information push module, bibliographic alerts are customized according to the preferences defined on users' profiles.

Thinking of web documents in terms of genres provides a selection criterion which is complementary to topic or subject, and which can also be implemented in automatic classifiers. The review offers a definition of web genres, a summary of achievements in automatic classification of web genres, and a perspective from which to sort out the increasing number of contributions on genres.

Popularity measurements of Cuban higher education: a webmetric analysis	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						webmetric; webometrics; visibility; traffic; web site; MES centres		We discuss the popularity of Cuba's MES (Ministry of Higher Education) centres, as well as their interconnectedness and visibility on the world wide web. The role of links in the positioning and visibility of these sites was studied because web browsers use link analysis (or hypertext analysis) to infer not only the content but the quality or the possible "authority" status of a web site. A webmetric study of the 17 centres with web sites was conducted. The relationship between the number of links and page traffic of the MES centres was determined by analysis of the browsers Google, Alltheweb, and Altavista, and also from the Internet Archive and Traffic Rank (Alexa ranking). Four results were obtained: i) the MES centres had better visibility in the browserAltavista, with a Standard Error (SE) 0,00210; of these, a significantly better value was observed for the 13(th) centre (superscript a); ii) as page storage in the Internet archive increased, more links or cites were received from the browsers; iii) the links and ranking in Alltheweb showed significantly better performance (SE +/- 0,23) and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0,44%; iv) significant differences exist among MES centre sites in the Internet archive, with respect to links and activity reported in the Traffic Rank.

This paper provides quantitative data regarding the effects of this limitation on the quantity and impact of the scientific production of a Spanish region measured via MEDLINE. It is estimated that 1/3 of the papers produced by this region cannot be identified in this database because the region does not appear in the affiliation address. Moreover, the impact of the region, tends to be undervalued since these collaborative papers are published in "better" journals and receive more citations than many other publications.

Bibliometric methods and social network analysis were used to examine papers indexed in the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-Expanded), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), MEDLINE, Indice Medico Espanol (IME) and Indice de Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades (ISOC) databases. 184 papers were identified, 79.89% of which were original research articles. Only four of these papers had been published before the 1990s. The mid 1990s saw a remarkable increase in the number of papers published (8-14 papers/year) with the highest productivity being reached from 2002 onwards (14-25 papers/year). The IME and SCI-Expanded/SSCI databases were those recording the largest numbers of papers, both in absolute (67.93% and 40.76 respectively) and singularity terms (42.39% and 21.74% respectively). The detected papers were published in 76 Biomedical and Documentation journals (82.06% and 15.22% respectively). The most productive authors were identified along with the main co-authorships and institutional collaboration networks operating in the field. These results are related to the importance of impact factor at both national and international level.

Three types of complementary analysis were performed via the creation, selection and use of a set of indicators of content, usability and accessibility. Two computer programs were used to check the accessibility of 135 webpages (15 for each website), paying special attention to the homepages. The points obtained in each analysis were weighted and used to produce a final score, i.e., the average of the content analysis score and the mean of the usability and accessibility scores. The evaluation of these websites revealed them to have important quality deficiencies that might have a negative impact on the communication of their functions as institutions linking universities and society in matters of R&D.

A previously validated assessment model combining 23 indicators of style, scientific content and diffusion characteristics was used for this purpose. This model classifies journals into four quality categories: 'very high', 'high', 'medium' and 'low'. None of the 28 journals studied fell into the top category, 25% fell into the 'high' category, 50% into the 'medium' category, and the remaining 25% into the 'low' category. A general improvement was observed compared to previous assessments of these journals, although deficient standardization and a non frequent use of the blind peer review process were still evident. In addition, their visibility (especially in databases) remains limited.

The activities of students in the library were also recorded, as were the library services they used. 2208 randomly selected students from the population of those studying for degree and diploma qualifications offered by the UCM were interviewed. Forty eight percent were found to use the library once or more per week. This proportion increased among students of the humanities, among those in the final years of their studies, and among those of any discipline who more frequently attended lectures. The activity most frequently undertaken by the students who used the library. regularly. was individual study using their own notes and books, or using books to which access was unrestricted. The most commonly used library service was personal loan. The results suggest there is a need for university libraries to plan reforms that would better adapt them to students' needs as well as those that might arise as a result of adaptation to the demands of the European Higher Education Area.			aarias@pdi.ucm.es						30	2	2	CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS	MADRID	VITRUVIO 8, 28006 MADRID, SPAIN	0210-0614			REV ESP DOC CIENT	Rev.

J	Martinez-Uribe, L; Macdonald, S				Martinez-Uribe, Luis; Macdonald, Stuart			A new role for the academic librarian: data curation	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						research data; academic libraries; e-Research; data-curation; scientific repositories; open access; cyberscholarship; academic librarians; data librarians		Academic libraries are facing a range of new challenges in the 21st century. Models of scholarly communication are experiencing a revolution with the advent of open access, with libraries adopting a lead role in self-archiving their institutional outputs in digital repositories. In addition, researchers are taking advantage of the computational power at their disposal, conducting research in innovative and collaborative ways that use and produce vast amounts of data. Such research-generated data underpins intellectual ideas, which in turn propagates new methodologies, analysis and ultimately knowledge. It is crucial that we preserve such mechanisms and output for future generations. With the experience gained from traditional cataloguing, indexing and organisational skills coupled to those acquired in developing, establishing and maintaining institutional repositories, the time is ripe for academic librarians to explore a new role. Research data need to be looked after from the moment of creation through their life cycle. The concept of data curation refers to activities like digital preservation but also those geared towards adding value to the data so that they can be discovered and reused. This article introduces e-Research and the likely function of academic libraries in this I domain. After this, data curation is described and several initiatives of interest for information professionals in this field are presented.

A case study is used to demonstrate these concepts, analysing the EU4 patents database and processing it with a tool developed by Pinar del Rio University. Ucinet software is used on occasion to map existing social networks. This makes it possible to produce results that demonstrate the relevance of patentometric studies to research projects, including the possibility of redirecting the objectives of a research project on the basis of this analysis.

The Cameo portrait identifies McLuhan's professional and academic interests, the authors that most heavily influenced his wave-breaking theories and the evolution of his line of thought in current trends of Communication. By analysing the relational information of citations contained in articles about McLuhan in the ISI Web of Science, we were able to create a map of his intellectual sojourns, including signposts of the most influential authors in his professional career, along with a second representation that shows the "footprints" his writings have left in the world.

J	Kempf, K				Kempf, Klaus			United we are stronger. Cooperation among the German scientific libraries	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						library cooperation; German scientific libraries; virtual libraries; digital age		Library cooperation in Germany is a tradition that predates the emergence of internet. This is explained partly by the absence of a "classic" National Library, as a single central institution. This absence has been replaced by the three major German libraries, which have distributed among themselves the function of a national library. The other reason for this tradition is the Federal political system and the responsibility of each of the Federal States in cultural matters, including libraries. This meant that at both regional and interregional levels, there has traditionally been a solid cooperation, at least among scientific libraries. Later the arrival of automation has facilitated the production of collective regional catalogues. With the entrance into the so-called "digital age", the tendency to cooperation has been intensified, so that today one can talk about an "age of cooperation". One example of the ease and assiduousness of this cooperation are the new services which, in most cases, supply several libraries together; others are the specialised virtual libraries, the consortium acquisition of digital media user licences, including national licences for certain items, and the cooperative creation of a long term national digital archive.

In this paper, we present a bibliographic review of those indicators' systems used for the assessment of universities in the OECD countries, paying special attention to those applied in Spain. The study shows the complexity that means the analysis and the structure of the indicators proposed by the literature, mainly due to the use of indicators is not only a technical or neutral activity, but it implies to make valued judgments and answer predetermined objectives. Therefore, until now, there is not a consensus among all the organizations involved in the approach.

First, quantitative data is offered regarding the university scientific journals that originate from journal directories (essentially, Cindoc, Ulrich's and Latindex). It then sets out a set of seven basic lines of action to improve their dissemination and impact: content digitalisation, inclusion on portals, free access dissemination, creation of multilingual versions, communication of new features, audience measuring and inclusion in databases. Finally, reference is made to the main agents that may carry out this type of action.

The scientific production of Marine Science in Spain during 1994-2004 as covered by SCI, SSCI & AHCI is analysed. A high precision (96%) but a very low recall (close to 30%) is obtained by the delimitation strategy based only on scientific journals. The mixed filter presents a lower precision (69%) but a higher recall (around 75%). The journal-based delimitation provides an incomplete view of the area in which high-impact documents published in journals of other disciplines are ignored. The interest of developing advanced filters for the delimitation of scientific areas and the importance of expert opinions in order to obtain a balance between precision and recall are stressed.

In public libraries, exploring and developing new links with the community, promoting new services, designing new models of internal communication or talent management, changing corporate image, or promoting organizational learning are also important areas of innovation. These activities are already recognized as crucial for innovating in the new "knowledge society". As a result, when we talk about innovation in public libraries it is necessary to consider it from a triple point of view: as an organization of services, in relation to its social function as an integral part of the community, and as a center for entertainment, information and learning.

A case study focuses on a small public library in Muskiz (Bizkaia/Biscay province), and its use of the social web to offer new library services. Cheaper access to technology may shift the capacity for innovation, from centres that have resources to acquire and manage proprietary solutions to institutions that modify their products and processes using open web services. We describe how scale affects a library's access to technology and positions it in technological discontinuity: in the 20th century, technology was on the side of larger structures but currently they are penalized.			ferjur@gmail.com						11	0	0	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inf.

Therefore, they should create services and initiate programs in response to the requests of the multicultural communities they serve. Segovia's libraries identified the information needs of immigrants through a series of questionnaires, administered through direct personal interactions with key informants from three distinct but complementary sources: public libraries, educational centres, and immigrant associations. We offer suggestions on innovative and optimal responses to the needs we detected.

The effectiveness of self-archiving is analyzed with respect to the feasibility of launching open access institutional and subject-specific repositories. Data were obtained from the Sherpa/Romeo database. Self-archiving is favourable for the implementation of institutional repositories because 56.8% of papers could be immediately deposited, a percentage that increases to 72% after a period of embargo and to 87% when papers published in full text journals are included. The feasibility of establishing biomedical and health science repositories for the Valencian Community is questionable, due to the fact that most publishers will not grant permission for inclusion in a repository unless mandated by the research funding agency, a practice lacking in our country at present.

To put it in other terms, we present an exclusively theoretical approach to the idea that intensive use of search engines, which is so common now, represents a threat to cultural diversity. First, with the goal of putting our study in context, we present two previous debates on the dilemma of protectionism vs. the free flow of cultural products, and then analyse the most relevant characteristics of search engines (with a focus on Google) to determine whether they constitute a credible threat to cultural and linguistic diversity on the Web.

In order to understand personal attitudes toward communication and information technology (CIT), some researchers attempt to identify user perceptions of efficacy, anxiety, satisfaction, and usefulness, based on attitude factors. We discuss some of the primary research findings related to user attitudes and perceptions toward information technology. In addition, we review key studies that have implemented these assessment methods, within both the general context of computer use and the specific environment of web technology. We conclude that the level of technological sophistication and capacity are less relevant to effective implementation than positive user attitudes toward the technology.

Curricula vitae (CV) of researchers are documents that collect data on individuals, institutions and works, and seen as a whole, are a potential source of inside information about the scientific activity of a country, But if they are not stored properly it is not possible to use this knowledge to conduct studies on them. Moreover, the absence of a single standardized CV requires the researchers to fill in multiple versions along their professional practice. The Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (Fecyt), together with the entities belonging to the Spanish system of science, technology and enterprises (Secte), have initiated the project Standard Curriculum Vitae.

The advantages of openness	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Editorial Material						free software; open source software; open software		One of the main consequences of publishing a program as libre (free, open source) software is that its source code is made available to anyone who wants to look at it. In addition, much other information on the development process is often easily accessible on the internet. Some of the consequences of "opening up" the process of building libre software are discussed, briefly exploring how these open mechanisms could behave in other areas.			jesus.gonzalez.barahona@urjc.es						1	1	1	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inf.

This approach is an alternative to SKOS-Core, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) approach to publication of thesauri within the semantic web. The advantage of our approach is that it provides significantly more semantic information than a thesaurus (and, hence, than does SKOS-Core). A two-level ontological architecture for domain representation is also described, consisting of a knowledge representation ontology [based on Ranganathan's (1967) facets] for the representation of high-level relationships in the domain and a domain ontology for the description of a particular field within the domain.

To this end, ISI categories are used as units of analysis, co-citation as units of measure, and pruning algorithms to simplify the relationship between categories in the visualizations. The results show that from the macrostructure point of view, biomedicine and materials science research provide the basic nucleus at first. Over the years this nucleus is consolidated and expanded with agricultural and soil sciences research. From the microstructure perspective, an increase is observed in the number of interdisciplinary categories, which occupy central positions, indicating increased interaction between disciplines that have traditionally been more important or visible and those on the periphery, or less well known.

Libraries are committed to disseminating these electronic documents, which usually requires that they compile and store them as well as guaranteeing their preservation. The best way to achieve this objective is e-information repositories. We briefly present an overview of the free software available to develop repositories, with a special focus on the software used to build Catalan cooperative repositories. We also review desireable system characteristics, such as the use of open communication standards between repositories, preservation strategies for digital content, and user communities.

Free software, or freeware, is one of the more often selected solutions, given the freedom to copy, modify and distribute it in addition to free licensing and the possibilities for integration with other applications. This trend is reflected in librarianship curricula, in which automation software, repository management software, and even Linux/GNU, among others, are explained in a variety of courses. This combination of organizational needs and freeware trends led a group of professors from the Faculty of Library and Information Science (UB) and members of the Work Group on Free Software for Information Professionals (Cobdc) to create a virtual laboratory for the use of free software for library applications, as a contribution to the professional community.

The proposed semantic web, a concept that appeared almost a decade ago, has had only modest impact. On the other hand, web 2.0, an autonomous evolution of the web toward a collaborative environment, has met with enormous success. The solution devised by web 2.0 has exceeded the limitations of natural language processing tools and statistical approaches. For that reason, it seems logical to analyze the potential contributions that web 2.0 concepts could make to further the development of the semantic web. Some ways of making the leap from a social web to a social semantic web are discussed.

The ontology will contain data from different and heterogeneous sources (bibliographic records, finding aids, catalogues, etc.). The project will develop a series of applications that get the most out of the ontology, beginning by a semantic portal. The portal will provide easy and intuitive access to a huge volume of information that comes from heterogeneous sources selected by domain experts. People interested in Cantabria will be able to find with as few clicks as possible, not only the information they are interested in, but also some contextual information that complements the one the user is watching, suggesting new navigation directions, and uncovering hidden relations.

Departing from current standards for the description of archival entities and authority records, namely ISAD(G) and ISAAR(CPF), the work described herein establishes a means to make semantic interoperability possible for archival descriptions under ISAD(G) in the context of the Semantic Web. For the purpose of this work, semantic interoperability is understood as the use of explicit semantics to facilitate archival descriptions integration with the main objective of fostering the automated or semi-automated use of the information. This paper introduces a mapping of ISAD(G) archival descriptions to an ontology written in a Web-oriented ontology language, as the main artefact to promote semantic interoperability in archival descriptions. It has been achieved through the introduction of a common ground for the definition of concepts, based on the use of shared definitions from in widely-used upper ontologies. The final aim is to provide advanced services and access facilities which can serve as improved access points in archival description.

In that sense, the virtual reference service is not an exception and the same happens with the rest of services provided by any information institution at this stage of policy desing. Unfortunately this kind of service does not have an international standard to support it. This paper aims to analyse the policy proposals established by organizations and projects, proposals that have been a guideline by establishing comparisons in aspects of foremost relevance like: service organization, staff, privacy and respect to the copyright.

This study is a part of a greater research project involving the Web OPAC online help system and the use of online help. In the subsequent pages, we propose a classification of error messages: those related to the OPAC connection operation, related to the OPAC searching data entry, related to the result pages access, and finally, those messages related to the results navigation task. Both the coexistence of messages caused by the basic operations of information retrieval and the presence of additional and enriched OPAC messages are evaluated. The adequacy of the error messages to the recommended guidelines and standards in relation to their structure, contents and display are also studied. To conclude, some observations, such as the identification of the error messages that the OPAC offered to the user, as well as their major and minor frequencies, together with comments about the persistent problems found in the error identification and information messages generation systems, along with some useful recommendations for future studies, are included.

The analysis is significant since CSIC is the Spanish institution with the highest co-authorship with Latin America. Results show that the use of WoS instead of CD ROM increases by 22% the region's visibility, due to the inclusion of new Chemistry and Materials Science journals. Universities are the main contributors to the relationship between CSIC and Latin America and a strong cooperation in the Physics and Chemistry areas is observed. Activity and impact indicators show that Physics is the strongest point in the CSIC-Latin America collaboration. Network analysis by area shows the institutional connections in each one of them and their different structure. Through citation analysis, a positive relationship between impact and number of participating countries can be detected, revealing the importance of collaboration.

The aim is to develop an information and documentation centre about industrial property on the basis of the deposit of EPO and USPTO collection of European and North American patents and databases that belongs to the Oficina Espanola de Patentes (Spanish Patent Office). The first step has been the designation of the Library as a Patlib Center (European Patent Office Libraries Network). With this new service, the Library tries to spread within the academic community the important role of patents as a source of information for technological research, as well as to provide information services about industrial property to universities, companies, the general public and specially the Parque Cientifico (Scientific Park) of Carlos III University in Leganes (Leganes Tecnologico).

We describe the development of research on ontologies in library and information sciences and in other disciplines interested in ontological problems. The emergence of a research agenda on ontologies is discussed in the context of the development of the internet and, specifically, in relation to the semantic web project. Finally, some implications of this convergence for the information professional are discussed: the integration of knowledge organization into a broader transdisciplinary research arena with a very promising future, the need to clarify the role and potential contributions of the information professional, and the urgency of adequate education and training in the new standards and technologies.

PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			English	Article						ontologies; thesauri; knowledge organization systems; ontology spectrum; types of ontologies		The number of papers written on ontologies has increased considerably over the last twenty years. This trend can be easily observed by searching words like "ontology" or "thesaurus" in databases. Despite this fact, there hasn't been a consensus about the significance of this concept. The graphical representation known as ontology spectrum must have generated a lot of confusion amongst readers. In this paper we argue that this confusion is due to the mix of the various types of knowledge organization systems with distinct objectives in the same graphical representation. Thus, constructing a formal ontology for a system does not always presume an improvement, frequently it is adequate with less complex representations.

J	Slavic, A				Slavic, Aida			On the nature and typology of documentary classifications and their use in a networked environment	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			English	Article						classification schemes; documentary classifications; library classifications; typology	RETRIEVAL	Networked orientated standards for vocabulary publishing and exchange and proposals for terminological services and terminology registries will improve sharing and use of all knowledge organization systems in the networked information environment. This means that documentary classifications may also become more applicable for use outside their original domain of application. The paper summarises some characteristics common to documentary classifications and explains some terminological, functional and implementation aspects. The original purpose behind each classification scheme determines the functions that the vocabulary is designed to facilitate. These functions influence the structure, semantics and syntax, scheme coverage and format in which classification data are published and made available. The author suggests that attention should be paid to the differences between documentary classifications as these may determine their suitability for a certain purpose and may impose different requirements with respect to their use online. As we speak, many classifications are being created for knowledge organization and it may be important to promote expertise from the bibliographic domain with respect to building and using classification systems.

The confluence of two elements produces this change: the complete digitization of the flow of production and the fragmentation and decentralization of the audio-visual market. The determining factors are identified, along with the risks and opportunities that media professionals must channel toward the development of a new model of audio-visual content management based on access and the hybridization of tasks and skills.									11	7	7	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inf.

The intent is to guide decision making about the visual relevance of people and organizations by analyzing the frequency with which they appear on television. Broadcast schedules/logs and press agency dispatches are studied with the goal of determining the level of visual presence in the audiovisual archives at which images of a person and/or entity are no longer added to a media database.

Spain's academic web space in the European Higher Education Area: an exploratory approach	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						webometrics; information visualization; network analysis; Spanish universities	NETWORKS	Spain's academic web space is diagrammed, together with its relationship with the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), with the goal of determining the topology, the outstanding universities, and our standing with respect to other European web spaces. Several co-link maps and network graphs visually represent these relationships among universities and web spaces. The results show that the Spanish network is rather isolated from other European universities, because the out- and inlink percentages are quite low considering the volume of content and the number of Spanish universities. On the other hand, Spain's academic web space is quite cohesive, with a significant nucleus that is strongly interconnected. We conclude that the limited use of the English language and minimal electronic publication of quality research in accessible repositories could explain this isolation. In addition, Spanish universities have a more local than international emphasis.

Research is needed to determine the advantages and limitations of this new indicator A study of publications in the Web of Science, 1994-2004, applied the h-index to researchers working in the natural resources area at the Spanish Council for Scientific Research (CSIC). One of the findings presented is that the h-index detected the most outstanding scientists; however scientists who follow a selective publication strategy, publishing a relatively low number of documents that are frequently cited, could be penalized for this approach in h-index based evaluations. The authors emphasize the need to avoid the specific limitations of each indicator by combining indicators in the evaluation process.

Digitisation of previously archived footage is a slow, expensive process that requires significant public funding. This fact, together with new technological developments, favours the opening of major archives to the general public (BBC, INA, B&G, etc.). For TV stations, digitising and media asset management (MAM) systems offer new tools and generate a new work environment, both for reporters and archival research.

Considering the qualitative rather than quan titative aspects of the extent to which different types of programs use them, the user needs range from the most general to the most specialized content. RNE, the Spanish national radio network, serves as a case study of the relationship between radiophonic informa tion and documentation. The center for radio documentation, at the service of professional needs, plans the document chain based on typology and then addresses the need to respond to general as well as specialized queries. All of this occurs within the framework of new digital technologies that affect broadcasting as well as handling and preservation of information.

This is accomplished in a distributed and collaborative fashion, using the web 2.0 or social web parameters. The web portal is an online university platform that supports the creation and diffusion of a wide variety of multimedia and didactic materials as a resource to lecturers, students and professionals. The TV channel is able to transmit live or on demand, carrying content from the newspaper library, image library, video library, or the complete media library using streaming and other technologies. This web portal also benefits from the fact that the multimedia documentation service coordinates access to e-learning tools in the Information Sciences Faculty. E-DocuInfo/TVDoc emerged precisely at the centre of this environment.

Nonetheless, the use of XML to encode and transfer electronic documents across networks and the development of various methods to describe the characteristics of various document types (XML schemas, RelaxNG, etc.) and their metadata have made clear the need for a more formal, structured approach to the design of various document types and their implementation using XML standards. This insight, combined with the requirements of new technological approaches to integrating software applications - web services or service-oriented architecture (SOA) - that rely on XML for document exchange across platforms, results in a need for documents whose structure is precisely defined. The work of Robert J. Glushko, specifically document engineering, provides the primary theoretical approach to this problem. Document engineering includes the activities necessary for the design of document types and their use as interfaces between systems in SOA environments. His work offers a formal, academic approach to what is currently,, one of the most interesting opportunities for information professionals.

The present is one such point in time. A new model for a university library is described, one that has emerged in response to two types of changes: those required by the information society and those needed for the development of a European Space for Higher Education (ESHE). In keeping with these requirements, a hybrid university library is now developing, whose management is based on the philosophy of globalization, the use of new information and communication technologies (ICTs), cooperation, and the quality of services provided.

At the same time, some no-cost applications (open source or freeware) allow web publishing by people and organisations that otherwise could not afford to do so. Three of these applications are discussed: NVU, Pages and Blogger. These three applications have various degrees of compliance with publishing standards and vary in terms of ease of use. The conclusion is that sufficient technical resources and publication opportunities exist so that any person or group's web presence is limited only by the quality of the concept and usefulness of the content.

Protection of the author's rights and protection of the user's personal information are two basic considerations that must be taken into account by those responsible for an organization's intranet. Although intellectual property rights and confidentiality are totally different in nature, both are discussed in this article from the perspective of how they should be managed by information professionals. In recent years we have seen how technology can contribute to violation of copyright law and personal confidentiality. This conflict can occur in our intranets if proper measures are not taken to reconcile the interests of all users, of those whose personal information must be protected, and of copyright holders.

An analysis is offered of websites widely acknowledged as being successful. These websites were those that led to the new concept web 2.0. Essential characteristics of this type of site are reviewed, such as employing important technologic innovations and novel ways of interacting with users. The second part of the paper analyses the significance of library 2.0 as a web 2.0 application for libraries. After a brief review of the principal definitions, a new one is proposed. Examples are given of the 2.0 services that libraries are currently offering or could offer in the future.

Microformats allow the semantic expression inside xhtml pages to be displayed in a manner visible to the user, thereby enabling a high level of description for specific types of resources (business cards, events, etc.). This particular use of DC microformats offers great potential for resource description in general, and is especially suitable for describing bibliographic resources. Also presented in this paper is a simple way for encoding DC in microformats using the Dublin Core Metadata Gen software, as well as an application that allows information included in the microformats to be displayed using the Mozilla Firefox extension, created for this purpose.

The research and academic community has taken advantage of them for exchanging ideas and information, thus converting blogs into a new communication channel to disseminate and discuss new scientific advances. However as has occurred with other traditional means of scientific communication, it would be useful to establish quality criteria for determining the extent to which blogs are a reliable way to exchange scientific ideas. In this article the quality of the formal structure of the blogs is analysed, as opposed to the quality of their content.			soniaj@cindoc.csic.es; salvador@cindoc.csic.es						10	0	0	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inf.

Taking this as a starting point, some reflections are put forward on the dimension of fraud in science. The singularity of Hwang's case, due to its scientific, social and media impact, is examined as a consequence of the persuasion mechanisms systematised in the so-called Routes of Scholarly Lying. Furthermore, the reasons for publishing fraudulent research, the inefficiency of peer review for detecting it, and the various mechanisms for managing and eradicating it, are presented.

As all alternative to the Impact Factor of Thomson ISI, other indicators have been proposed, although none of them have achieved sufficient acceptance and widespread use to be systematically applied. Among Spanish initiatives, most notable are the Potential Impact Factor of The Spanish Medical Journals, developed by the Siniac team (Information systems and research activity indicators) from the Instituto de Historia de la Ciencia y Documentacion Lopez Pinero (Valencia, Spain), and the Indice de impacto de las revistas espanolas de ciencias sociales (In-Recs), developed by the EC3 research group at Library and Documentation department of Granada University (Spain).

The objective of this study is to verify whether web sites specifically committed to free access to information satisfy the quality criteria of accessibility, web positioning and quality of the source code. The results obtained find that accessibility must be improved upon, source code quality is merely acceptable, and web positioning is good. In short, bad practices were observed that should not occur in sites whose objective is to facilitate the free access to information.

J	Gomez, AD				Delgado Gomez, Alejandro			The indeterminateness of archival translation	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						archival discourse; archival ethnography; conceptual analysis; context; indeterminateness of translation; translation		Archival science is suffering a radical change, often written in English. For non English-speaking communities, this implies the need for a translation of the most relevant del archival texts. However this poses several challenges and difficulties: different disciplinary communities, different uses of terms by different English-speaking communities, and different understandings, associated to different national traditions. In this regard, this text suggests several examples, as well as potential risks derived from, a bad or poor understanding. In the same way, it explores some of the answers proposed by archival researchers, particularly essays published by Eric Ketelaar According to this background, and on the basis of the Quine's theory of indeterminateness, this text suggests two approaches to the problem: a sound ethnographical study of socio-cultural environments associated to different archival terms and discourses, as well as a deep conceptual analysis of some of the most relevant concepts in modern archival science.

The introduction of the information technologies (ICT) has modified the structure of the companies and the ways they make businesses. The article analyzes two subjects: a) If these modifications have generated a "flew economy" or only a temp growth of the productivity that, nevertheless, stays in the tracks of the classic economy. b) If the definitions of company-network, company-in-the-network, and alike, are applied correctly, or it is necessary to consider a new structure of companies like a new ontological category.

The purpose of these strategies is to assure that the traditional documentary cycle can be adapted, to the extent that current technology permits, to web pages; allowing for the selection, processing, conservation and permanent availability of these digital resources. National libraries have often led these initiatives and, within Spain, the Biblioteca de Catalunya (BC) has initiated the Padicat project (Digital Heritage of Catalonia), devoted to archiving the contents of the Catalonian Web.

Nevertheless, this is not happening in Spain's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). One of the causes of the low rate of adoption is the difficulty for managers to value and measure the benefits generated by intranets inside the organisations. With the traditional methods of economic valuation being questioned, we present the example of an analysis of benefits that intranets generated for 80 SMEs of the ICT sector, carried out by means of a methodology of measurement that combines qualitative and quantitative indicators. The I results obtained show the positive contribution of intranets to these organisations.

The Provincial Public Library of Valencia was chosen because it meets the following conditions: a high level of use, a very heterogeneous public, and reliable economic and user data. Our aim is to show that investment in public libraries is highly profitable in terms of the information and training offered and from a cultural and social point of view. The use of analytical models that measure costs versus profits in public libraries can serve to raise awareness on the part of both citizens and politicians of the benefits of investing in public libraries as well as to highlight the need for investment in public lending libraries to continue to grow. In order to ensure growth in the use of public libraries in Spain, increased investment is clearly needed.			amat_marflo@gva.es; ortells_mil@gva.es; aurorarapun@yahoo.es; latorre_ign@gva.es						6	0	0	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inform.

The Digital Dossier Transmitter is a work-flow system implemented by the Idescat's Enquiry service that allows queries from citizens about statistical information to be managed electronically, resulting in considerably shortened response times. After submitting the electronic form available on the web, users are sent an acknowledgement message once their queries are validated and, subsequently, they receive the requested results by e-mail. Queries are circulated to one or more Area Heads (according to the complexity of the subject), who then assign them to the appropriate experts for drafting the answers. The final files and results are gathered together by persons designated, in each case, to << sign >> the response (the designation is generally based on the type of requestor). The system allows procedures to be standardised, an unavoidable step for obtaining the ISO quality certification. Approximated implementation costs are given.

The results show a substantial increase in the volume of pages indexed, approaching 40.000.000.000, of which 40% are in the .com domain. The .es domain represents less than half of the pages from Spain, due to the large number of pages registered under international domains. In all, our country's presence in Google content is approximately 1.1%. This is consistent with results obtained regarding languages, since Spanish occupies a very humble sixth place (2.6%) and Catalan represents 0.09% of the total. Spanish is overwhelmingly the principal language in Spanish-speaking countries, but its presence in the United States is, percentage-wise, quite low.

Beyond the unquestionable importance of factors such as technical equipment, software or standards of compression, and storage and indexing, the conversion of an audio file into binary code has other implications that are briefly reviewed. The essential parts of this process can be summarised as follows: changes in professional profiles and production routines, the integration of languages, and the possible universality of documentary resources.

J	Zubiete, CL				Zubiete, Carlos Leal			An application of co-citation based visualisation techniques in the field of film studies	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						filmic citation; co-citation; film genre theory; intertextuality; information visualisation.		The application of information visualisation techniques to quantitative citation analysis in scientific documents has proved very useful in revealing hidden structures and research trends in several disciplines. A similar approach is proposed in the field of Film Studies based on the concept of << filmic citation >>, understood as an allusion to a different audiovisual text that blends seamlessly into the flow of the cinematographic narrative. Thus, this technique allows the detection of patterns of influence between audiovisual texts. A visual representation of the co-citation data for Classic Holywood films extracted from the IMDb database illustrates the utility of this technique for Film Studies and, particularly, Film Genre Studies.			carlos.leal.ext@juntadeandalucia.es						11	1	1	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inform.

An analysis is offered of the steps to be followed, the most suitable data resources, the different kinds of matrices, and how these have to be processed. The results permit distinguishing between the different steps taken and the differences in processing these matrices. The study finds that asymmetrical matrices provide more information than symmetrical ones, that there is greater discrimination with the cosine than with the correlation, and that crawlers obtain more accurate information than search engines.

The paper also describes the development of an experimental prototype based on the proposed model. The applied methodology for the prototype's development is a combination of three methods: Metadata mining, Multidimensional scaling (MDS), and a Focus+ Context technique called Fisheye. Finally, a user test is conducted, whose results suggest that the proposed model of VIRI is useful for information browsing and retrieval, and is satisfying for the end-user as well.

This work begins with a financial analysis of both the print and electronic journals purchased by the DGB from 1999 to 2004. It then presents projects implemented by the UNAM's library system for responding to the journal crisis in order to maintain an efficient service. A description follows of the agreements and activities undertaken by the libraries that carry out cooperative purchasing of information resources. The essential element among these resources are the journals, regardless of the format they are acquired in, and the main purpose is for sharing information among the 142 libraries that make up the UNAM library network.

The majority of them run on open soft-ware tools. Institutional repository projects are being carried out following an evaluation of the software's features. Nevertheless, the evaluations to date have been comparative, focussing on the features offered by each tool, rather than on other factors. In order to overcome this limitation, this work analyses the different published models for evaluating institutional repository software, studies the approach adopted in each case, and proposes a model. This model is oriented toward the study and definition of informational-documental processes, the users, the characteristics of the collections, and the context of the project in which it is framed.

The principle of provenance is essential to decide upon the organisation of medical histories archives and all the documents included in them. The study assesses the management of the above mentioned health archives in order to highlight the importance of appropriate cataloguing, shelving and storage of medical records for all efficient day-to-day running of hospitals. The results will be useful in estimating the approximate cost of a proper archives management when taking into account factors such as patients staying longer than expected I in hospital or the need to repeat medical tests.

Indicators at macro-meso level are presented by: geographic region, thematic areas and enterprises. Results about scientific activity in companies show a very short commitment to R+D, low number of patents, scarce participation in international publications, as well as insufficient interaction between public and private sectors. Scientific production comes basically from I public sector (Universities and CSIC), while the technological activity is located in very few enterprises which patent mainly in the Spanish office. A closer look into Spanish regions reflects a high concentration in Madrid and Catalonia in publications; nevertheless, Navarra and Basque Country stand out in patents. Results reflect that Industry is not taking advantage of the public sector research efforts for its development.

An analysis of the published Spanish literature on this topic helps to determine the areas of interest in which researchers and the library community have been working and thus to have a good idea of the current library reality. Issues that have been most heavily researched are covered here, such as subject authority files, interfaces and their impact oil the use of the catalogue. The article concludes by stating that studies carried out in Spain are limited when compared with others oil the international scene. There is a lack of studies in many research areas that could be of benefit to opac indexing and subject retrieval.

J	Romero, JC				Romero, JC			The role of metadata in digital preservation	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						metadata; digital information; preservation; digital preservation		The problem of preserving digital information has now taken on great importance. As the amount of digital information continues to grow, the concern about maintaining access to this information accessible will increase. As elements for describing digital documents or DLO (Document Like Object), metadata play an important role in providing information about the logical aspects of the DLO they refer to, and consequently, in all the tasks related to preservation. At the same time, metadata are digital information, so their preservation must be borne in mind. In this respect, several projects and work groups have been devoted to studying the use of metadata for digital preservation and the preservation of metadata themselves.			jorgecandas@gmail.com						9	0	0	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inform.

The variety of terms to mention them is only the first sign of disparity. What is the good of them?, what does characterize good rules?, what steps must fulfil rules to be legal?, which sides of the library usage are usally included?, what do they forget? To answer to these questions we have taken 40 different rules, from two extreme backgrounds, Catalonia and the United States, and we analyse them. The result is a synthesis thought to help public library managers to write rules.			info@zonaele.com						26	0	0	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inform.

This effort permitted us to find over 16 million pages, on approximately 300,000 web sites, which have been analysed in terms of contents, connectivity and technologies. The analysis of the data reveals several statistical similarities with observations made about the characteristics of the web by other studies conducted on subsets of the global web mostly related to the presence of power laws. On the qualitative side, the role of academic and governmental centres is fundamental for enhanced connectivity in navigating among the sites of the web of Spain.

Free electronic resources of use for hospitals	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						Internet; hospital libraries; online systems; digital libraries	INFORMATION; INTERNET; QUALITY	There are many high quality, health science information resources freely available on the Internet. Many governmental and non-governmental organisations have web pages with very good information on health sciences that are highly useful for health professionals and patients. However these reliable resources intermingle on the Web with other sites of low quality. The main tasks of today's medical librarians are evaluation, selection, analysis and organisation of resources available on the Web in order to deliver them in a useful form to the end users. This article describes the setting up of the Aldebaran Virtual Library that serves the health staff of a large hospital and consists of high-quality health sciences resources available freely over the Internet. The article focuses on the criteria and objectives used for selecting and organising the content.			mmerced.rodriguez.sspa@juntadean-dalucia.es; fernandolechuga82@hotmail.com						16	0	0	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inform.

J	Espinoza, N; Rincon, AG; Chacin, B				Espinoza, N; Rincon, AG; Chacin, B			Use of web-based tools by health sciences professionals at a Venezuelan university for searching scientific literature. A cross-sectional study	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						databases; Internet searching skills	FACULTY	The increasing use of databases in all areas of knowledge has produced important changes in scientific practice. These databases allow for more efficient searches of indexed and published journal literature in all areas of specialisation. This study attempted to learn which strategies were used by faculty members of the Health Sciences Schools of the University of Los Andes in searching for scientific information. We performed a cross sectional study in which the faculty of the departments of Medicine, Dentistry and Nutrition were interviewed to identify their skills in searching. The majority of the professors considered themselves as "good" or "very good" in their skills in using the Internet. However 71% of them use general search engines to retrieve scientific information, whereas only 29% used databases exclusively on health, such as Medline, Lilacs, Cochrane and others. The main difficulties reported for accessing full text articles are their cost and the means of acquiring them. We conclude that the university faculty members do not know which are the best tools for obtaining reliable scientific information. Hence the quality of the documentation they use for staying in,formed and for their future research is questionable.			norelkys@ula.ve; rinconga@ula.ve; belkyschacin@hotmail.com						12	1	1	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inform.
