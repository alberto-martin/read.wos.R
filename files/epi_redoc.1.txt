Images are increasingly present on the web, and therefore any web analysis must consider them. The huge volume of available images requires the use of large computation infrastructures in order to generate this kind of analysis, as well as specific computer vision algorithms. Big data technologies are discussed that can be used for large-scale image processing. In addition, a novel distributed algorithm is proposed that can efficiently retrieve images from an online collection at low computational cost. This algorithm can be used in web analysis or future research requiring detailed image study, without requiring any special hardware.

The popularity of the expression has blurred the outlines of the concept that not only insists on the size but also on the value of the collected and processed data. Social media, which are characterized by a rapid expansion and by the diversity of interactions and contents that circulate in them,have been incorporated to the big data studies to become resource of useful data for researchers, organizations and companies. This:paper observes the typical singularities of the social media analysis inside the big data and, after scrutinizing existing measuring tools, reflects on the opportunity and the necessity of a solution to examine trends and the impact of the profiles that get to set extensive networks.

The basic format of the matrices displays each document as a case in a row that can be attributed different variables in the columns. One limitation to this approach was hitherto that relational databases typically have an upper limit for the number of variables, such as 256 or 1024.

We based it on an analysis of the social media profiles of major museums and art centers in San Francisco, London and Madrid. Tracking and monitoring of these profiles was performed from December 2012 to December 2013. In this study, not only is it important how many followers or how many profiles are used in online media communication, but also the communication and curatorial strategies that these institutions apply. We explore the possible development of dialogue spaces, interaction, participation and creation that move toward the idea of a complete virtual and social museum.

Accepting the subjective presence of the documentalist in his/her productions, this article opts for the recognition and explicit statement of this role, recommending two actions. First, we suggest that public higher education institutions combine the technical training of mass media documentalists with training in critical thinking skills. Our study analysed the subjects covered in course syllabi to detect the deficiencies to be addressed in meeting this objective.

Although still controversial, the ACN has a more cost-effective organization as a result of working with multiskilled employees, i.e. journalists that must carry out many different tasks simultaneously, compared to the EFE and EP model, which employs photographers, camera operators, and specialized writers in an effort to prioritize the quality of the final product.

Social networks are a particularly suitable environment for the emergence of new communication modalities and possibilities. This report focuses on the phenomenon of informers, a type of anonymous platform that emerged in early 2013 in Spain, initially supported by the Facebook social network. The report examines the origins and rationale for informers, as well as the potential legal liabilities that could affect site administrators, content generators or participants through the I like button or additional comments, taking into account current national and international legislation.

Over the decades, the curators of these places have begun to request that these artistic works be returned, conscious of the significance that many of these works now have. Some institutions and museums have responded to these requests by providing copies of the original works. Although traditionally these copies were handmade, digital resources, such as audiovisual technology, are now being used. The Taull 1123 project (Lleida, Spain) is an example of the use of these new tools for the benefit of artistic heritage and of modern visitors.

However, this growing volume contrasts with poor image description in the vast majority of cases. The value of a picture to illustrate the original event, or to be used in other contexts or situations, is based on an appropriate description. The purpose of this paper is to reduce the difficulties encountered in describing images by suggesting ways of categorizing the images and the agencies, specifying uses, and illustrating descriptive differences. The implementation of these recommendations will improve the quality of records, help to achieve successful retrieval, and increase positive evaluations of web sites by clients and users.

We identified 16 different social media sources from which Altmetric.com retrieves data. However five of them cover 95.5% of the total set. Twitter (87.1%) and Mendeley (64.8%) have the highest coverage. We conclude that Altmetric.com is a transparent, rich and accurate tool for altmetric data. Nevertheless, there are still potential limitations on its exhaustiveness as well as on the selection of social media sources that need further research.

We studied the presence of these authors in social networks and the impact of their EPI publications indexed in Web of Science using different altmetrics. The results showed that 77% had a public profile on Google Scholar Profiles and 70% had an account on both Linkedln and Mendeley. This platform has served as the tool with higher statistics and obtained the highest correlation with the number of citations in Web of Science (0.516). Other networks were Twitter (55%) and Slideshare (47%); despite its lower presence in the sample, Slideshare offers users higher visibility, receiving the highest number of user hits. We also present detailed altmetrics for 47 EPI authors, ending with a reflection on the difficulty of analysing altmetrics at author level.

For example, there is a relationship between the use of social networks and the profession (engineers are likely to be interrupted more often); between the use of social networks and marital status (knowledge workers who have no partner have more work interruptions); between social origin and working in public administration, and also the socioeconomic situation and working in humanities-social sciences. In contrast, technological disruptions seem to equally affect married and unmarried workers, although singles tend to be more interrupted by their phones. Administrative workers are also more interrupted by mobile phones. All these data are important because of the great impact of interruptions on productivity. More research is needed to identify other variables of a social nature that predispose to labour disruptions.

Since then, it has been used in Spain to classify the scientific activity. In order to better determine its characteristics, development and scope, we studied the literature and analysed its use by university research groups in Spain and in other national and international settings. From the data obtained, we designed an ontology based on the combination of the Nomenclature and keywords identified in the literature. The result is an ontological model adapted to the semantic web technologies that provides a higher degree of expressiveness than the original Nomenclature. It also helps to solve problems such as obsolescence and the absence of certain emerging subject areas, facilitating the classification of scientific activities and increasing its usefulness.

This article considers the keys to interpreting this apparent contradiction between the current media ecosystem and the strategy underlying the launch of late editions for these mobile devices. To do so, we establish a sample of native evening newspaper applications not available in print, examine them and interview the prime movers. The conclusions reveal the unique role played by this newspaper type within the daily information process.

This paper presents an overview of these initiatives and their development in Spain, analyzing the open data sets available and the functions and features of the applications developed for this purpose. The information source used in this work is the portal http://datos.gob.es, of national scope which organizes and manages the public information catalog of Spanish administrations. This source offers information about these data sets and the applications and utilities developed. The analysis shows a diverse distribution of these open data sets that requires grouping by metacategories for its study and analysis. The level of development of the applications seems low but it may be due to the incipience on freely available data.

This research aimed to establish the role of public libraries in relation to local collections and bibliographic heritage. Aspects discussed include the design of criteria for the assessment and recovery of these collections and the suggestion of a diagnostic process to be followed. Our inventory produced two outcomes: 1) the creation of a digital reference repository that helps to systematize and disseminate the heritage collections existing in public libraries; and 2) evidence of how these collections lack needed policies for recovery, identification, processing, preservation and dissemination, which results in difficulties in terms of their valuation as heritage collections.

Text visualization and exploration, we argue, constitute a subfield of data visualization, and are fuelled by the advances being made in text analysis research and by the growing amount of accessible data in text format. We propose an original classification for a total of 49 cases based on the visual features of the approaches adopted, identified using an inductive process of analysis. We group the cases (published between 1994 and 2013) in two categories: single-text visualizations and text-collection visualizations, both of which can be explored and compared online.

These data can be used in the assessment of students, instructors and the processes themselves. However, although this wealth of data exists, it is still difficult for those who teach (and interested stakeholders) to verify a hypothesis, extract conclusions, or make decisions based on the facts or situations that are discovered. This paper introduces an educational data analysis model based on visual analytics, learning analytics and academic analytics and using a software tool that allows performing confirmatory and exploratory data analysis through interaction with the information gathered from a typical Learning Management System. The main goal is to enable the discovery of knowledge on the specific learning process that, in turn, will permit its improvement.

We create cognitive artefacts that integrate data visualization and cognitive processes in order to increase our ability to understand the complexity of the external world, made even more complex with the Internet and rise of social media. In this paper, we combine Twitter, as a type of fieldwork site, and Social Networks Analysis (SNA), as both an analytic framework and set of methods, to capture, analyze, and visualize empirical data, both statically (figure representing point in time) and dynamically (video reflecting longitudinal data). We present Flocker, a tool designed for real-time visualization and representation of network activity using Twitter as an illustrative case.

We define co-use as the co-occurrence of scientific information requests by pairs of users recorded in platforms of scientific journals. We used search data from the University of Navarre to the ScienceDirect platform in 2012 in order to test the validity and to analyze the possibilities of this methodological approach. We conclude by emphasizing the viability of this methodology when exploring the research interests of an academic institution along with the relations among different disciplines.

The selected unit of analysis was the Key Words Plus descriptors (KW+), the unit of measurement was their co-occurrence, and the Pajek and VOSviewer tools were used to generate and display the social networks. The results show two complementary images of research: the static structure, distinguishing between clinical and basic research, and the evolutionary dynamic, analysing both the most established and the emerging lines. The main contribution of this work is to present a methodology for the visualization and detection of the main research lines over time, demonstrating its applicability and its predictability in scientific and geographic domains.

The map was generated from the relational matrix based on the citation, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling formed by the nearly 20,000 publications (journals and conference proceedings) registered in Scopus. The map layout is based on a variant of a force-directed algorithm using Noack's proposal of an edge-repulsion energy model. The interface allows the publications' bibliometric indicators and the cluster structures that they form to be displayed based on their shared use by the authors of the documents. To facilitate navigation, the interface automatically positions the reference areas and subject categories which are viewable via zoom-and-pan. The interface may be found to constitute a useful tool for analyses of the Scopus publications' presence in different scientific domains, and of the global distribution of the publishing capacity of different countries and regions. It uses the method of overlaying maps to locate subsets of selected publications in the context of the global publication structure.

The crisis we face is not only economic but also technological and due to changes in the organizational model, and we are already seeing some effects of deregulation and no planning. We can only establish solid information policies if we find a set of actions around which a wide spectrum of agents can be aligned without friction. 1. In the print world, policies should allow us to determine what exists and make that easily accessible, and know what is little used and will tend to be used less and ensure that it is preserved. 2. Research funding institutions can and must agree to facilitate open access to information and data. 3. Finally, the library-organization must be able to provide digital books, offer digital information that anybody can use, and ensure that born-digital materials are passed on to future generations. To this we must add the need to plan for information literacy training in schools. In these times of change, surrounded by uncertainty and some notable weaknesses, part of our professional duties should be devoted to elaborate agreements enabling us to take coordinated action in certain directions.

Information policies and scientific publication	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						Information policy; Evaluation; Scientific journals; Databases; Repositories; Rankings; End users; Latindex; SciELO; Redalyc; Dialnet; CSIC databases		The lack of an integrated information policy for scientific activity evaluation has led to a wide range of information products and services that are used for such purposes, although they were not originally designed for that. While it is true that these tools have limitations and deficiencies, and in several cases are technologically and methodologically obsolete, possibly the biggest problem is sustainability in the present times of economic crisis, especially if they do not take on new strategic tasks, such as assessment, which is a priority today. Various products are reviewed in this critical essay: scientific journal portals, with the recommendation to implement value added systems like SciELO instead of simple database management; current databases on offer, with questions about having national products without metrics; institutional repositories, with the observation that they have forgotten to serve authors, their real end users; and institutional ranking systems, suggesting that some have not learned from the successes of those based on composite indicators. Recommendations include institutional coordination of services; professionalism versus incompetence; and an end to the economic drain caused both by licensing underused databases and by maintaining outdated policies based on criteria that have been abandoned at the international level.

The financial results of the 93 biggest media groups and enterprises in the EU provide evidence of not only the pernicious effects of financialization, but also the increase of regional divergences within the EU-28. The Mediterranean countries, which have got the worst results in all of the indicators analysed, are the most exposed to those dangers and confirm the poor advances of the media sector regarding convergence of management and economic solidity, at the expense of their capability to fulfil their social aims. The crisis has strengthened the position of the media groups in the North in front of the weakened South, that already had a greater dependence by its greater exposure to partisan interests. The daily circulation of press in the EU fell from 115.33 million copies distributed in 2008 to 82.54 in 2012, 27.73% less. 64.5% of the major media listed in the EU-28 is concentrated in five, countries. 52.7% of the media has significant holdings in financial institutions.

The absence of legislation regulating neuromarketing experiments and the secrecy of the private sector due to its client agreements, it is difficult to know how brands use this discipline. Currently, the scientific sector in Spain has great interest in neuromarketing. Sixteen of Spain's 75 universities (21%) have a research group, institute or center that studies neuromarketing, but this activity has had little international impact. Meanwhile, a fifth of the Spanish professional commercial sector shows real interest in neuromarketing, either having a separate department dedicated to it or offering this service to others. Ethics, traditionally presented as an impediment to the development of neuromarketing, should not pose a problem for the development of this field of knowledge.

The effects and their consequences are studied in this paper, based on available library statistics. A significant decrease in expenditure for materials, the downgrading of collections, library closures and a growing increase in usage were observed in 2012. Changes in content consumption habits are also highlighted, with special attention to adaptations to digital change. Facts 2012: the operating costs of Spanish libraries amounted to 990.1 million euros (+0.54% compared to 2010); if the increase in the CPI is taken into account, the cost increase is actually 5%. Personnel expenses represent 66.9%. Public libraries (PLs) reported 594 fewer employees than in 2010 and there were 154 fewer in academic libraries (-5.6% and -2.6%, respectively). The PLs incorporated 3.5 million volumes (-31.2% compared to 2010). Visits to libraries: Total 216.4 million (in PLs +20.5% / 2010); 401 libraries (20%) did not have computers for public use and 46.5% had no opac yet.

Through a series of interviews With managers of a group of Chilean museums, we identified elements to consider and problems that often affect museum communications in general, despite the diversity of these institutions. In the museums examined, we observed different ways of understanding the concept of communication. Such differences are linked to geographical location, ownership or affiliation, as well as other dimensions of the museum such as mission, objectives of the institution, and the communications vision.

It will be collected by the Spanish agency Cedro (Centro Espanol de Derechos Reprograficos) and the virtual campuses of universities will be required to comply. We analyze a regulatory precedent in Spain for this legal reform, which levied a tax on potential private photocopying (for personal or "fair" use). This precedent has common features with the current reform: the levy on private copying was an appropriation of public access to print information, while the levy on universities implies the appropriation of the digital commons.

The basic entities (work, expression, manifestation and item), as well as their attributes and relationships are described, and RDA structure and substantial changes from existing AACR2 rules explained. New terminology, new cataloguing models, and specifically "the rule of three" are included, no abbreviations, annotations of numbers and errors, and use of square brackets. New MARC 21 fields are explained: the 264 field for publisher data and the 3XX field for content, media and carrier types. The paper addresses the application of these changes in cartographic documents, especially in the 255 field for mathematical data elements, containing a sub-field for scale, cartographic projections and coordinates, and in the physical description field, including record samples. The essential role in the RDA development and training of cataloguers for cartographic documents is carried out by an expert group called Magirt (ALA). The rules offer freedom of application for cataloguers and cataloguing agencies; therefore, their interpretation is required, taking into account national cataloguing conventions. The instructions have already been translated into the major world languages.

At the same time, the pressure on journal publishers, due to academic promotion processes and the international background of authors, requires agreement on how to act against the recurrent cases of ethical misconduct that occur in practice. The aim of this study was to discover the opinion of Spanish journal publishers in the fields of Communication, Education and Psychology regarding 16 types of improper conduct. Of the 203 publishers surveyed, 39.9% answered the online survey. The quantitative data obtained provide an understanding of the publishers' level of concern regarding ethical aspects of scientific publication: the frequency of misconduct, the ease of identifying it, its perceived gravity and possible future trends.

As a consequence, individual scientists are affected in different ways as they are obliged to adapt to the new dynamics in terms of their own work and their relationships with colleagues. This paper presents the case of research undertaken in ATLAS, one of four big experiments in high-energy physics using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva and one of the most important big science experiments to date. By gathering and analysing several micro-cases of individual experiences of ATLAS members, we propose that the size and complexity of the experiment do indeed influence the personal relationships among scientists themselves and also their relationships with their organizations. As a result of this analysis, we put forward a set of propositions concerning these relationships that might potentially be generalized to other big science experiments.

Data related to the annual research output of 81 public and private universities are shown, with a focus on collaborative institutional networks in six broad areas: Experimental Sciences; Engineering and Computer Sciences; Life Sciences; Medicine and Pharmacy; Social Sciences; Arts and Humanities. Through the visualization of co-authored works, the main institutions in each area are identified. The results show that the Spanish university system has produced 299,887 documents in 10 years with an increase of 200% between 2002 and 2011. Experimental Sciences was the area with the largest number of publications with almost 40% of the total. Collaboration profiles show that the university system changed from a model in which authorship from a single institution was the norm, to one in which international collaboration is the most prevalent.

The present study provides a bibliographic review of the literature on research collaboration and identifies pioneering work on the topic, the types of studies undertaken and the variables analyzed. Several approaches are discussed: the "classical" approach, based on bibliometric indicators, which has taken on a new dimension with Social Network Analysis; and quantitative and qualitative approaches, which attempt to investigate the motivations and dynamics of collaborative work. The study of scientific collaboration has been undertaken using a variety of methodologies from different disciplinary perspectives. This was made evident at the Congress "Scientific collaboration: a multidisciplinary approach" held at University of Valencia in November 2013, which brought together leading experts on the subject from around Spain. This special issue of Revista Espanola de Documentacion Cientifica contains ten selected papers presented at that event. We conclude this introductory paper by examining the main challenges that research into scientific collaboration should explore.

J	Melero, R; Hernandez-San-Miguel, J				Melero, Remedios; Hernandez-San-Miguel, Javier			Open access to research data: a track towards scientific collaboration	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						Open access; research data; data repositories; data citation; open access policies		Knowledge transfer should be facilitated by the opportunities offered by information technologies, as they affect the access and distribution of digital objects. However barriers to the access and reuse of scholarly research, whether economic or copyright-related, inhibit the sharing of this valuable common good. The open access movement promotes the elimination of these barriers and advocates for an open access culture of sharing and reusing materials, while guaranteeing that authors be duly acknowledged and that the data be used responsibly. If scientific papers have historically been essential for the communication of science, in the digital age it is now their building blocks that have gained greater importance, especially the observational, descriptive or experimental data that underpin the articles. Open research data can be reused, transformed by new methods or aggregated to other sources. Open access to research data avoids redundancy, provides transparency on how they have been obtained and allow for their validation. This work provides an overview of some initiatives and recommendations on how to share and manage research data and foster open access to it, as a means of collaboration between groups or individuals working in similar disciplines.

To this aim, we use information about the participation of a sample of HSS researchers from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in diverse interaction activities with social agents. In addition to highlighting the extent to which HSS researchers engage in non-institutional interaction activities, we analyse how these interactions vary according to a researcher's academic position and the type of social agent. Our findings are of interest for future initiatives aimed at promoting interactions between science and society in this area.

Many recent scientific achievements like the human genome sequencing or the discovery of the Higgs boson have taken place within the "big science" paradigm. The study of scientific collaboration needs to take into account all the diverse factors that have an influence on it. In the case of big science experiments, some of those aspects are particularly important: number of institutions involved, cultural differences, diversity of spaces and infrastructures or the conceptualization of research problems. By considering these specific factors we present a set of parameters for the analysis of scientific collaboration in big science projects. The utility of these parameters is illustrated through a comparative study of two large big science projects: the ATLAS experiment and the Human Genome Project.

This paper considers the role of Jose Casares Gil (1866-1961) for producing a historical study on the relation between research schools, scientific sites and scientific collaboration. Jose Casares ran several university and institutional laboratories, such as the central customs laboratory of Madrid, and the chemical analysis laboratories of the faculties of pharmacy in Barcelona and Madrid. These spaces allowed him to be in contact with many students, colleagues, industrialists and members of other institutions. By considering these spaces this paper will discuss whether Casares succeeded in creating a research school.

To do this, we use a theoretical multidisciplinary perspective of scientific collaborations, which combines the approach of networking and resource sharing (Granovetter, 1973, Lin, 2001) with a sociological approach to power relations (Bourdieu, 1997). Following the intuition of Nan Lin (2001), we conclude that the positions of researchers in institutional hierarchies are crucial to the way they access resources. Occupying an elevated position represents a sure and steady exchange of resources. This means always being able to receive at least the equivalent of what you give, in a playing field of academic power relations that is perpetuated over time.

Information on the characteristics of the networks comes from a questionnaire completed by 191 Spanish academic scientists working in the field of nanotechnology. The article considers the networks that these scientists establish with other individuals and through organizations and examines how the degree of embeddedness and nodal heterogeneity of these networks affects scientists' output. The findings show that the balance achieved among members of a network -whether individual or organizational-- explains more about the quantity and quality of academic output, than the size of the network. Regardless of their size, more integrated and geographically balanced networks of individuals enhance academic production; additionally their geographic balance also serves to enhance the quality of the output. In the case of organizational networks with a well-balanced institutional diversity, there is a greater quantity of academic production, as opposed to those organizational networks characterized by a geographic balance.

But plural authorship tends to complicate the attribution of merit to individual scientists, which is the basis of scientific evaluation. I argue that collaboration does not necessarily entail co-authorship, though in many cases the latter is an option that the individual scientists might not choose, at least in principle: individually authors might separately publish their own contribution to a collaborative project in which they had taken part, or papers could explicitly state what contribution each individual author had made. I ask, hence, why it is that scientists prefer to 'pool' their contributions instead of keeping them separate if they are pursuing, amongst other things, individual recognition. My answer, following an inferentialist approach to scientific knowledge, is based on the view of the scientific paper as a piece of argumentation rather than as a piece of knowledge.

A questionnaire was prepared and sent to employers in the information science sector and to professors and students from the Master's Program, asking them to evaluate 29 competencies. Professors and students were also asked to indicate to what extent these skills are included in Master. The most notable result is the existence of a significant gap in the ratings made by students about the importance of each competency and their satisfaction with what was learned. The evaluation framework presented can be used to identify deficiencies in the Master's curricula and to make recommendations for improvement.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the opinion of academics in the field of accounting about their research productivity and the factors that could explain the differences with respect to other areas. It is a cross-sectional study of the population of members of ASEPUC by means of surveys. The results show that the causes of the differences in research productivity are explained as: problems for delimiting the research in accounting, a lack of motivation due to rejected papers and non-compensated efforts, sparse incentives for researching, and a lack of methodological training, as well as the amount of time needed for dedication to teaching activities. Tenure, professional position, productivity and university size all influence the opinion concerning scientific productivity in accounting.

The current research proposes a pragmatic procedure of analysis and retrieval focusing on press news items and based on pronominal request modes formulated by end-users. This has a clear potential for extrapolation to other journalistic genres, such as interviews or news reports, which would have to be separately and specifically addressed. This study begins with the construction of macro-propositions based on a corpus of news items and following rules that are both practical and easy to reproduce. The goal is to obtain a means for accessing press libraries and archives that is both standardized and automatic.

The present work describes experiences and perceptions of Spanish biotechnology companies in their collaboration with the public R&D system. Results show that almost all the biotechnological companies with R&D activities (93.6%) have cooperated with the public R&D system. The main barriers found by the companies are the excess of bureaucracy and the slow response of public researchers. Results obtained also suggest the need to establish public policies and programmes to promote knowledge and technology transfer from public research centres to companies, with a special focus on encouraging researchers from the public R&D system and on improving how Technology Transfer Offices work.

These activities are essential for the economic success of countries but have traditionally revealed a low presence of females. This paper adopts a "macro" approach and presents technology indicators by gender based on the analysis of the patents applied for from the European Patent Office (EPO) by Spanish inventors during 1999-2007. From a total of 6,860 patents, at least one female inventor was found in 20% of the patents. Inter-gender differences in patenting are observed by institutional sector, with female involvement being above average in the public research sector; and by technological field, with a higher presence of females in chemistry. The relationship among the sex of the inventor, the institutional sector of the assignee and the technological field of the patent is explored through correspondence analysis. The article points out the relevance of patent-based indicators by gender for identifying gender inequalities in technological activity and supporting policy measures oriented to promote women's integration in the science and technology system.

This article explores the involvement of researchers in various types of dissemination and identifies practices and differences among scientific fields. The study analyses a large sample of researchers from eight scientific fields of the Spanish Council for Scientific Research (CSIC), who were surveyed about their participation in diverse dissemination activities. Two indicators related to individual and institutional dissemination activities were constructed from a factor analysis. The ANOVA test indicates different dissemination patterns between researchers in social sciences and humanities and those from experimental science fields, though the difference is not very marked. These results may be of interest for the future focus of actions to promote scientific dissemination.

There is evidence of inappropriate behaviours associated with several factors that call for a better regulation of the conditions in which authorship of a scientific work is assigned. This regulation falls within the competences of the associations of scientific publishers and the journals themselves. The aim of this paper is to analyse the situation of international policies and editorial practices of Spanish journals in the areas of Science and Technology. A transversal content analysis of the manuals of good practices in academic publishing and a sample of 37 Spanish prestigious journals was carried out, with special attention paid to the criteria for authorship, derived liabilities, the role of acknowledgements, number of authors, author ordering, and responsibilities of the corresponding author. The results give cause for concern: only 15% of the manuals and 8% of the journals manage to declare these criteria properly. We compare these results with those of other areas, such as Biomedicine, where similar studies have been carried out, and we discuss the impact of non-regulation on authors' behaviour and scientific ethics, as well as the implications of co-authorship in scholarly evaluation procedures.

The results allow for a ranking, led by TVC, Canal Sur and ETB, and also show that online audiovisual archives are at a mid-level of development compared to overall digital press archives, with significant weaknesses in query systems and results management. The broadcasters tend to give more importance to the display of content than to the quality of the search systems. Finally, the established indicators can be useful for analyzing other television archives.

This study examines characteristics of journal articles in the fields of social sciences and humanities that were published by professors and researchers from two Catalan universities. Data were extracted from databases providing free access to the records of both academic institutions' scholarly production. The results obtained reveal the importance of open access to these kinds of records, as well as the existence of differences among areas of knowledge in quality, level of collaboration, percentage of disclosure, and language of publication, although there is a general trend towards a greater relative use of the English language.

Cross-sectional descriptive study is made, to evaluate the global quality, accessibility, usability, interactivity, updating, quality model and information given in 53 different websites belonging to Spanish hospitals with more than 500 beds. Only 22 (41.5%) of the websites analyzed fall into the upper half of the scale used. As such, the mean quality of these websites is shown to be low. On one hand, both accessibility and usability of the evaluated websites were notable, with specific sections for health professionals and hospital suppliers. On the other, the websites were characterized by a limited incorporation of tools for interacting with users, a poor presentation of information about health, diseases, waiting lists and care activities, as well as a deficient updating of their content and almost no adherence to quality references. In short, the websites of large Spanish hospitals are simple informational spaces that don't facilitate the interaction, participation and collaboration of hospital users. In conclusion, websites of large Spanish hospitals, in addition to being informative spaces, should facilitate more interaction, participation and collaboration with hospital users.

The first part was entitled: Collection management in Spanish university libraries. Plans and regulations ( I): selection. In the present work thirty texts are studied which regulate the acquisition of information resources at Spanish university libraries. These documents describe acquisitions as part of collection management and special attention is focused on their structure and contents, as well as on their concept and objectives.

Analysis of production and supervision (1976-2012)	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						Direction of doctoral theses; photographic documentation; photography; doctoral theses; scientific production; university		This paper analyses the production and supervision of doctoral theses on photography in Spanish universities, i.e., in all centres where courses related to this subject matter are taught. The period of study runs from 1976 until 2012, and we have applied bibliometric techniques to conduct this analysis. We have used as the main source of information the Teseo database of the Ministry of Education, whose information has been contrasted and completed with the Dialnet virtual library, the Cisne catalogue, the Network of University Libraries and the Centro Virtual Cervantes. In all, 275 theses were identified, of which 39 had been co-directed. The results describe the quantification, the topic, the distribution by universities, centres and departments, and the number of directors and co-directors. By way of contextualization, there is an introduction into the incorporation of photography into official and university studies.

It includes a detailed description of the occurrence of papers and journals in each of the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) categories in order to gain insight into the structure of knowledge in CE research, its patterns and associated trends. Bibliometric methods are used to analyse the multi-assignment of papers and/or journals to the various JCR categories. The total of journals (598) is distributed among 115 categories, with 54% of them (324) and 56% of the documents assigned to more than one category. The results of a co-occurrence analysis of the data corresponding to the different categories are mapped using the Visualization of Similarities (VOS) technique. The co-occurrences are plotted on a two-dimensional representation revealing the distinct clusters formed by their proximities. The result was 13 clusters. The categories that stand out as most central and most interconnected were "Engineering, Chemical", "Chemistry, Physical", and "Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology". No relationship was found between the co-authorship index and multi-assignment into categories. The 14 categories selected as the most productive represented, in 2006, 39.7% of the journals in the JCR's 1st quartile.

The Triple Helix model is proposed for the analysis of the role of public hospitals in innovation processes. We discuss the role of public hospitals in innovation and in economic and social development, and identify this role as a 'fourth mission' of hospitals in addition to their widely recognized threefold function of healthcare provision, education and research. We discuss the evolution of hospital administration from healthcare towards the 'entrepreneurial hospital' model. More specifically, we investigate the extent to which the incorporation of full-time researchers can help to foster innovation at research and healthcare centres affiliated with the Spanish National Health System. Data were obtained through a survey of researchers, research group leaders and heads of departments and centres where these researchers worked, as well as through content analysis of researchers' annual reports.

The demand for an increasingly diversified production at TV stations is leading to the need to prioritize image retrieval from the archives for reuse. Efficient alternatives for automatic metadata extraction, indexing and searching are sought, and text information to describe images continues to be necessary. The documentary image processing is extremely costly in human resources, with dedication times of two, three or even more times the length of the treated material. In parallel, part of the audiovisual production is indexed during the production process by people other than archivists, librarians or information scientists. Therefore, a transformation of the traditional tasks carried out by the above mentioned professionals is becoming more evident; on the other hand, these professionals continue to be isolated and less hybridized than expected with other labor profiles.

Second, we analyze the implementation level, typology and problems of developing documentary products in the documentation centres. For the first time we report a map of the implementation of documentary products in the Spanish television stations. Other results found were: journalists perform the selection of the original materials in 8 of the 10 television stations studied; few documentary products combine text and audiovisual information, and these are usually created for internal use in the news room and not for the audience.

For this reason, it is not surprising that advertising materials are often included when filmmakers donate their work to a film archive. However, these materials are not always properly catalogued and their dissemination and use is quite limited. This paper describes the quantity and variety of advertising documents preserved in the Spanish film archives, emphasizes their importance as primary information sources for understanding the history of advertising in particular and of cinematography in general, and explains some of the difficulties and challenges of analysing them as documents. The challenge of documentary control of these materials lies not only in the amount of work, but 1) the lack of a methodology that encompasses all documentary procedures and 2) the lack of qualified personnel.

Only cases where films illustrate news pieces about non-cinema related topics were taken into consideration. The basic legal aspects about the use of these sequences are mentioned. The study results can help in the decision-making process about tasks related to the analysis of trailers and electronic press kits. In recent years, there has been a steady increase in the use of film clips in the news, especially on issues of "Society" (40% of total). The results show that 20% of the use is as a metonymic function (when one element is replaced for another with which it has a close relationship, causal, spatial or temporal, and the pictures do not show the narrative element but something that is part of it, such as replacing an author for his work) and 80% environmental or illustrative (supporting the information offered). When extracts do not exceed 20 seconds, may be used without legal permission, what is known as a fair use chrestomathy.

It requires professional handling in order to facilitate user engagement and avoid verbal aggression. To illustrate this point, the article examines the comments posted to the online edition of Marca, the major Spanish sports newspaper. Empirical assessments of the data alongside interviews with the people in charge of the service were utilized. The analysis of the automatic filters, the Moderation Technology Platform (MTP), as well as the human filters comprehensively shows the itinerary through the system of every posted message. The study reflects on the best strategies to improve the quality of the online discussion. Results: The user history and the vocabulary blacklist seem to be the fundamental tools for moderating user comments. Marco removes 40% of the comments received. In practice, it has been observed that the percentage of inappropriate posts increases with the total number of posts sent by each reader: for 2 posts the rejection rate may be 14%, but for 9 it can reach 33%. One key issue to improve the quality of comments is the involvement of journalists in the Conversations.

Other times it is used when there are no current images related to the story or just to fill the schedule grid. However, not all archive materials can be reused; contractual rights, intellectual property and individuals' fundamental rights must be preserved. The lack of awareness of these standards and restrictions can create problems. Pictures from the Internet have become another common audiovisual source, but due to their special characteristics, they must be used very carefully.

The evolution of journalistic documentation and the need to respond to the organization of content generated in video collections and television archives, in particular news broadcasts, have created new areas and niches of opportunity for library and information science professionals. The research that is being carried out in Mexico on the analysis of news broadcasts and content representation on the web is presented. The documentary news treatment is crucial to strengthen the quality of content representation and ensure the relevance of discourse analysis for its organization, accessibility and preservation.

Some of the current key challenges and future action lines are discussed: clarifying the mission, the ecological niche and strategic objectives of the discipline; taking care of the disciplinary core and addressing the peripheries; building and looking after the brand and main stakeholders, relocating the student as a prime client; negotiating a permanent observation point to allow the design of curricula based on the labour-market and student needs; programming the educational levels within the framework of life long education; rebuilding and pursuing the interdisciplinary dimension of information studies; modulating technological training according to social changes and student profiles; and ensuring operational quality and addressing the continuous evidence-based improvement of the pedagogical methods. The reflection focuses on the Spanish case, but incorporates an international perspective.

PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						Library and information science; Universities; Spain; Spanish Network of Information and Documentation University Centres and Departments (RUID); LIS education; Statistics		This article aims to provide an overview of the current state of library and information science (LIS) education in Spanish universities. Data have been gathered from official statistical sources (Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports and National Institute of Statistics) and universities' annual reports, in order to complement data provided by members of the Spanish Network of Information and Documentation University Centers and Departments (RUID). Among other issues, a general decrease in the demand of LIS undergraduate studies and a slight increase in postgraduate studies are observed. Finally, the article presents several reflections on the challenges that these studies are currently facing, and suggests strategies that may be followed to strengthen not only LIS education but also the profession as a whole in this country.

The municipal communication structures are essential in these processes, which are designed to shape positive perceptions of government action. However, these structures have undertaken very few initiatives to examine the treatment of news events in the press. In this paper we present a tool to analyze the media agenda concerning municipal affairs, based on political and administrative management of municipalities, in a context in which the management and evaluation of information is added to the standard functions of the communications office.

Recently, a group of researchers have increased the criticism of this approach and advocate a social turn. From this point of view, methods such as discourse analysis are used to try to learn from the language of users how they generate and share knowledge in the social context. Other methods that could contribute to a better understanding of this aspect include social network analysis. The article describes how this method has been applied to the study of information behaviour, shows a practical application and discusses the professional and methodological implications.

Although Colombia reported the highest rate of growth among Latin American countries in the Scopus database and is improving its scientific communication practices, the country now has the challenge of combining these performance results with a greater emphasis on quality indicators. In order to achieve greater international visibility, policy adjustments related to improving scientific production are needed, as well as a more efficient incentives system for researchers and higher education institutions.

UNED joined the European research project OpenScout --which offers value-added tools and services for learners, educators and technology providers- and participated in the design, creation, analysis and evaluation of a model of informal learning. OpenScout draws from a federated repository of educational resources, using and re-using the existing materials and generating new ones, in a creative, collaborative, multilingual international initiative. The cultural adaptation process has been analyzed in the Spanish context. The main strengths of OpenScout, linked to the re-use of open contents in the educational process, are described. In addition, we discuss the project's capacity for integration into larger virtual communities, seeking synergies from combined use with the most popular social networks.

The so-called social media have emphasized the 'social' aspect, i.e., the collaborative and cooperative qualities, and social learning is one of the results. Information professionals, who have always been inclined to share information and innovations related to their discipline, have taken advantage of the possibilities that social learning offers. Strengthened by solid networking that has been fostered by years of initiatives like EXIT or E-LIS, librarians and information scientists improve their daily practice by learning collaboratively. From ground-breaking lists like IweTel or Publicas to blogs like Biblogtecarios or Dokumentalistas, each professional has been able to build her or his own personal learning environment. Various professional networking online environments are described, and special attention is given to the recent Social Biblio project and its active learning network.

PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Editorial Material						Content management; Information technologies; Information management; Information professionals		Technical solutions for content management have reached a high level of maturity. Under the heading of ECM (enterprise content management), several technical approaches for the management of unstructured information have been grouped. The acceptance of content management in different contexts is indicative of the value that these practices contribute to organizations. There is, however, a risk of interpreting this maturity as a synonym for being past its prime: we should consider whether there are still some opportunities for improvement and niches of activity on which to focus efforts, or if instead there is little room for innovation. The author contends that once we have laid the foundation for the deployment of such solutions and content management has become a familiar term for information technology (IT) users, there remain many opportunities related to: a) the analysis of data usage and user experience, including complex issues such as opinion mining, and b) the design of ECM solutions that combine best practices in the areas of IT and information management.

This new system allows those in charge of radio programs direct access to documentary content, and places documentalists at the center of the production process. In this article, the impact of the ARCA system on the professional routines of program production is analyzed. The article describes the typology of documentary archive content that can be used to improve programming quality, both in conventional broadcasting and in parallel broadcasting of added value on the radio web.

The amount of digital data and of its sharing is growing fast, and a lack of proper management could limit the potential benefits to stakeholders (researchers, governments and public funding agencies, research managers and libraries, and finally the publishing sector). The aim of this review is first to place the sharing of electronic research data in the context of its appearance and of open environments; secondly, it describes the life cycle model of data preservation; finally, it describes several initiatives dealing with methodologies and technologies. In parallel, international developments and highlights needs that exist in Spain are described.

Journals are assigned to 300+ pre-defined subject categories and 26 broad subject areas to produce league lists. The set of 134 journals assigned to the Library and Information Sciences (LIS) subject category and a sample set of 50 other LIS journals, scattered across several other categories, were analyzed in the latest edition (SJR-2011). Recommendations are made on how SJR could be enhanced by its developers to include simple customization options in the interface to facilitate a more efficient look-up and more valid comparison of the standing of journals and other serials and to reflect the prevailing preferences at the institutions where the rank positions in journal league lists are used to inform career advancement and funding decisions. It is argued that extending the current three-year citation window to five years would be more appropriate for all disciplines, and would also make SJR comparable to metrics-based journal league lists produced from the open access Microsoft Academic Search (MAS), Google Scholar Metrics for Publications (GSMP), and Eigenfactor.org (EF) data and the subscription-based Journal Citation Reports (JCR), which pioneered the idea of a metrics-based journal league list.

Besides Total number of published papers, several indicators are concerned with quality dimensions of published papers, such as International collaboration, Scientific leadership or High quality publications. However, official rankings are provided solely on the basis of one indicator: Output (total number of published papers). This paper presents a statistical I-distance method that integrates all the indicators into one value, which therefore represent a rank and show which of the input indicators is the most important for the process of ranking. Our results clearly showed that Excellence with Leadership occupies the most significant spot.

They must prove they are not an expense but rather an investment that yields net benefits with a return on investment(ROI) that in some cases can reach 4.5%. Five methods to calculate the value of library services, and some Spanish initiatives with this purpose, are described. The conclusion is that information services have plenty of annual activity data, but the lack of knowledge about the necessary methodology limits the capacity to exploit these data.

Although the intrinsic goal of cultural policy is the satisfaction of citizens' cultural rights, in most cases even these are not fulfilled. We propose brand new cultural policies that pursue such rights but are also able to lead the transformation of the production model and the achievement of other social goals. The dimensions of the cultural sectors have causal effects on the wealth of European regions. The proposed new policy should recognize intellectual property rights and their economic effects in a new way, facilitate cultural entrepreneurship, democratize the use of the premises and public spaces, and try to understand in more depth the relationship between individuals and cultural facts.

Journalistic documentation systems do not always offer the precision required to meet the specific demands of their end-users (journalists, historians, teachers, social scientists, general audience), as is the case with factual data. The retrieval of fact-based information is optimized by determing how users will ask for these data, simulating their pronominal searching behaviour, and then transforming those search modes into analytical categories for use by press documentalists. However, such studies should focus on a specific journalistic genre (in this case interviews and "statement texts") because the conditions and structures of each genre or text type impose different analytical procedures aria rules. Nonetheless, the resulting analogies and extrapolations should be carefully studied to improve the accuracy and relevance of the information system's search results.

There are two lines of evaluating the knowledge economy: the first is based on the use of summary indicators in a model with four pillars: regulatory environment, education, ICT infrastructure and innovation; the second is more quantitative, using economic techniques of accounting knowledge. We then defend the use of an existing international summary indicator that provides an overview of the challenges and opportunities for the generation and use of knowledge in Spain, enhanced by the results of a recent study on the dissemination of knowledge in various productive sectors. After completing the analysis from both perspectives, we obtain some conclusions and recommendations that would enable a more optimal use of knowledge in Spain.

J	Del-Rio, JN				Del-Rio, Jose-Nicolas			Space as a filter. Accessing online museums' content	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						Online museums; Information architecture; Data management; Cataloguing; Architecture; Virtuality		The online museum has been defined since its early days as a place devoid of spatial references. However, institutional communication and content mediation in museum websites is commonly linked to the museum's physical space. This connection produces a mismatch due to a lack of correlation between the physical museum's topology and the Net hypermedia system. Consequently, access to museographic online information is mostly laid out in taxonomic structures, typical of gallery cataloguing systems, rather than syntagmatic structures, inherent to online exploration. Furthermore, the profusion of online references to the museum's architectural structure help to consolidate the museum's physical space as a model for the online discourse, as well as to restore the museum's building as an identity symbol, a value blurred by virtuality.

The aim of this paper is assess the coherence between the importance assigned to strategic publics and the way museums communicate with them. The study was done on a wide sample (111 entities) of museums in Catalonia. The results indicate consistency with only a few groups, suggesting that museums are still in an early stage of adopting any new models, but a trend towards broadening the scope to include groups of interest other than museum visitors.

The Assets project has contributed to this goal by developing innovative content-based search technologies and services, improving existing functionality, and designing more user-friendly interfaces. This paper describes in detail some of the new services that were implemented in a replica of the Europeana website. A user evaluation process was conducted in several European countries, with a total of 51 usability tests performed. The results reveal the benefits and drawbacks of the portal. The identified problems were systematically prioritized. In the final phase of the project, a redesign resolved 74% of all usability incidents. The result is a number of features that enhance the original Europeana portal, giving the user more and better search tools.

Scores on the Shanghai Ranking HiCi indicator are related to the number of highly cited researchers (HCR) by university. In the 2013 edition, methodological changes have been made in listing highly cited authors. The main aim of this paper is to analyze these changes and the new HCR distribution by country. The paper also lists the new HCR from Spain. At the national level, Spain increased its global representation to 2.52% and at the institutional level 23 universities are scored on the HiCi indicator, helping to configure a new map of research excellence. The paper concludes with a preliminary assessment of the impact of the new lists on the position of Spain's universities in the Shanghai ranking.

As applied to informative communication, Gomis (1994) shows how journalism develops and operates its own rhetoric. With the arrival of the Internet and specifically with the opening of public communication to the average citizen, the use of participation as a rhetorical resource gains prominence and at the same time users add the rhetorical uses to their contributions.

Twitter is proposed as a method to study how the box office behaves and how leaders emerge among feature films. This project utilizes the Ten go ganas de ti ("I want you") case to analyze the use of Twitter in the communication campaign of a Spanish film, focusing on the producer's and lead actors' official profiles. Thought leaders unconnected with the production that emerged during the advertising campaign are also investigated. In an effort to understand Twitter as a model for communication campaigns, the official profiles of four films are analyzed: Tengo ganas de ti, Impavido, Lobos de Arga and Els nens salvatges.

School libraries failed to become established in the pre-university context and in 2010 still had no firm structure. There have been and still are experiences and best practices, but the reports published over those two decades show the precariousness of the school library in Spain. Public libraries grew and transformed themselves but failed to develop, or only poorly developed, educational services for citizens no longer pursuing an official education. However, they presented a strong offering across the entire spectrum of sociocultural activities: reading clubs, storytelling, conferences and workshops to train people on the use of new technologies.

Since the late 80s of the 20th century, Spanish libraries have undergone a process of modernization and engagement with their audiences. Educacion y biblioteca encouraged these changes and brought together a stream of librarianship committed to social action by libraries, public service values and the democratization of culture. During its existence, Educacion y biblioteca was open to all librarians, who used it as a forum to discuss projects and share best practices. As a private and independent project it offered a collaborative work experience and networking.

Despite the abundance of information on the aims and activities of progressive librarianship, few efforts have been made to define this way of framing the thought and action related to librarianship.

After an automatic and manual review of the principles, guidelines and criteria of priority levels A and AA, a percentage analysis showed that none of the universities surpassed these aspects entirely for either of the two web pages analysed, although the university with the best accessibility on both web pages was the University of Granada, followed by the University of Alicante. The study concludes by recommending revisions and adjustments to resolve these problems and to facilitate web accessibility.

In this work, the impact factor was decomposed into five independent variables, as applied to journal category, fields, and areas considered in the databases of the leading provider of science indicators, Thomson Reuters. A Principal Component Analysis was employed to find the sources of the variance and a Cluster Analysis was used to detect similarities. In spite of systematic differences between disciplines, the principal components explain 78% of the total variance. From the statistical point of view, some categories of Science are closer to the Social Sciences than to Science and vice versa.

Furthermore, although Rett mainly affects females and the causes of both diseases are very different, they have in common that both are genetic disorders. To carry out the analysis we used two databases, Medline and SCI - each with its advantages and biases but complementary to each other - together with a multidimensional analysis methodology in order to determine the relationship between output about these rare diseases and the advances in the field of Genetics. The results show a clear difference in research patterns for the two diseases, but a convergence on a common factor, genetic influence, although this is more pronounced in the Rett syndrome. Finally it concludes that the great milestones in the field of genetics, both specific (mutations in genes that cause disease) and general (the human genome sequencing), significantly affect the scientific activity surrounding these rare diseases.

This situation was studied from 2001 to 2012, taking into account different variables: budget, collection size, number of research staff, research output, and use of the collection. In addition, full-text citations in the scientific output of the UPV from 2008 to 2011 were analysed to attempt to study the correlation with the budget and the use of the collection. A correlation was not observed between the budget allocated to information resources and scientific output, with the correlation being strong between the budget for electronic resources and scientific output. Finally, it was not possible to determine a cause-effect relationship between the budget and scientific output.

We analyse whether the age, size (measured by number of faculty members or number of students) and student-teacher ratio of universities generate significant differences between research activity indicators, distinguishing between recognition (number of 6-year research periods), scientific activity (production, collaboration, impact, visibility), innovation, competitiveness, and training capacity. The importance of the size of the university (number of teachers) is confirmed, as the largest universities had better indicators, and the effect of both the age of the university and the student-teacher ratio was nullified.

The analysis applies indicators concerning both activity (quantification of authors, journals or Lotka's Law) and relationships (citations by author, journal co-citation between authors and co-word analysis) using the Web of Science's Social Sciences Citation Index as a data source. The results provided by the activity indicators show that it is a relatively recent field of study, which verifies compliance with the Lotka's Law, and where the most productive authors and journals do not necessarily coincide with the most cited ones. The co-citation analysis has identified authors of reference in the field. Finally, the co-word analysis has allowed the identification of the research topics comprising the area of study and classified into widely developed issues, specialized peripheral issues, peripheral underdeveloped issues, and emerging subject matters. These are the most relevant, in that they identify important current issues that are still poorly developed.

J	Campanario, JM				Miguel Campanario, Juan			Contribution of Spanish universities to the experts panel of ANECA's ACADEMIA program	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						Universities; ACADEMIA program; ANECA		This work analyses the contribution of different Spanish universities to the experts panel of ANECA's ACADEMIA program. This program consists of the initial evaluation of university teaching staff. The study looked at the distribution of experts by university and the relationship between the number of permanent teaching staff and the six year research periods obtained by the university. Results suggest that a relatively few universities supply a great number of experts to the ACADEMIA program. In addition, a positive correlation exists between the number of experts and the number of six year research periods or number of permanent teaching staff. These results suggest that the pool of evaluators reflects the reality of Spanish universities. No significant bias seems to exist in the appointment of experts.

The main goal of the study is to show that some astronomical and astrophysical information is still not taken into account in describing different astronomical resources as well as cartographic material. This information could eventually be incorporated as description fields of the aforementioned cataloguing rules. Such fields would allow us to carry out a much more complete and adequate description of these astronomical resources. We have focused on celestial objects appearing in astronomical images which can be found in astronomical archives and libraries. First a brief survey of astronomical information supplied by Google Sky and its linked databases, SIMBAD and NED is performed. Subsequently, we show how the existing description fields describe celestial cartographic materials, and finally we present a new proposal consisting of the desirable minimum parameters which could be included in bibliographic records.

Network analysis of Spanish universities according to their journal publication profile in scientific areas	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						Universities; Spain; maps of science; social networks analysis; publication profile; bibliometric indicators; research activity	SHANGHAI-RANKING; ISI-RANKINGS; COLLABORATION; INSTITUTIONS; EXCELLENCE; SPAIN	This study presents a descriptive analysis of Spanish universities according to their journal publication profile in five scientific domains during 2007-2011. Two universities have a similar journal publication profile, if they publish in a high number of common journals. This idea led to the possibility of mapping universities and thus offering an enriched view of the Spanish higher education system. In order to do so, we analysed the areas of Social Sciences, Exact Sciences, Engineering & Technology, Life Sciences, and Health Sciences. We also used the centrality indicator of social network analysis to identify those universities with a greater role in each area; that is, with a higher number of direct connections with the rest of the universities. Finally, the application of this methodology within the context of scientific policy is discussed, for searching for potential scientific partners.

Scopus (2003-2008)	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						Scientific production; research specialties; higher Education; Universidad Politecnica de Valencia; research evaluation; Scopus		This study analyzes the scientific output and research specialization at the Universidad Politecnica de Valencia (UPV) as collected by the SCOPUS database during 2003-2010. The 11,126 documents published represent 23% of the regional production and 2.8% of Spanish production. The analysis of the evolution of subject specialization shows that more than half of the production is based on Engineering, Computer Science, Chemistry and Mathematics, as the main areas. A third of the works were published as conference papers. Furthermore 95% of the papers were published in English and received more than 99% of the overall citations. The comparison with other national polytechnics shows that the UPV is second only to the Univ. of Politecnica de Cataluna in production and citation. It maintains a dominant position in Agriculture, Biology, Chemistry, Decision Sciences, Social Sciences and Chemistry. Although its main specialties are technical, the other less technical fields are more representative with a higher visibility, thereby confirming its distinctive profile. Finally, the impact analysis shows that the decrease in expected visibility corresponds to an increasing number of papers published in journals of the third and fourth quartiles. Despite this decline, the UPV has a higher citation rate than that of the other Spanish polytechnic universities.

This work attempts to offer a first glimpse of the situation in Catalonia based on data retrieved from the Web of Knowledge using a dual approach: filtering for the category Information Science & Library Science and performing a subject search. The results show that while teaching in the discipline has a long history, it was only in the 2006-2010 period that scientific output began to be significant, thus reducing the relative importance of bibliometric studies, which previously had been overwhelmingly represented. Moreover, the amount of output produced by women is only one-third of the total, even though their presence is greater than that of males in Catalonian classrooms.

Traditionally, information was accumulated for official use only but now it is generated for offering to the public. This transformation is the result of information technology and communications, whose use has changed the relationship between governmental institutions and citizens. These are now demanding information and Government has become one of their best suppliers. Similarly, the possibility of providing open public data converts this information into an abundant and free asset. Such information versatility involves a modification of the traditional definition of document and draws a clear distinction between the concepts of documentation and information.

Web positioning techniques are applied in order to improve the relevancy of web resources. Webmasters usually use SEO tools to analyze a web site according to some positioning factor. They are required to be updated to achieve two basic goals: to increase the user's satisfaction while searching the web and to decrease web spamming. We have studied the trends that affect positioning algorithms and optimization techniques. Several SEO tools were analysed in order to learn which functionalities have been implemented. Furthermore, an experiment was performed to test how the positioning factors help optimize the results and if these factors are present in the functionalities found in the SEO tools. Finally, a literature review was carried out to detect future trends in search engines' algorithms. Results show that SEO tools help in the optimization process but to an insufficient degree; therefore the algorithm's evolution study suggests that there is a need for major updates in the short term.

As a result of this evaluation policy, the number of Spanish social science journals present in Journal Citation Reports (JCR) has increased. In this study we have prepared a descriptive analysis of the presence of Spanish journals in the JCR between 2006 and 2010, comparing the data obtained with those achieved by other Hispanic American countries in the same period. We studied the historical evolution, distribution by country, quartiles and thematic areas, and analyzed the evolution of the impact of major journals. Altogether, 52 Spanish journals were identified in the JCR Social Sciences Edition in the year 2010. As for the subject area, 40% correspond to economics and psychology. In the period of study, the number of journals indexed in the JCR has increased by 2500%. Finally, we discuss the assessment of these journals as a sign of quality by national evaluation agencies, and conclude by recalling that the publication in journals indexed in the JCR is an indication mentioned expressly for the Social Sciences.

An analysis is made of the number of institutions with valid URLs suited for cybermetric analysis purposes and the type of URL syntax (subdomain or subdirectory). Likewise, multi-domain and redirection practices are detected. For units with an identifiable area of knowledge (faculties, schools, departments, and research groups, centers and institutes), a thematic analysis is also carried out. The results indicate that the Spanish academic space has a complex structure, with abundant redirection and multi-domain practices, with a predominance of subdirectories in institutions and subdomains in products, and where the natural sciences have - by number of associated entities and URLs - a major presence.

Complaints are directed mainly towards the different forms of creative production, but also towards the regular contributions that are carried by the journals. In this paper we analyze the journals used by the teaching and research staff of fourteen Spanish faculties of Fine Arts between 1977 and 2010. The identification of 1,355 professors and researchers active in these areas led to the retrieval of their articles published in journals indexed by the databases Dialnet, ISOC and Art Bibliographies Modern. The results obtained have been contrasted with the evidence relating to the quality offered by the platform "Spanish Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities" (RESH). We conclude by confirming the low rate of publication in regular journals by researchers in Fine Arts; the thematic dispersion through publication in related areas such as history, literature or philosophy; and the mismatch between the journals most used by teachers of fine arts and those that meet a greater number of quality criteria.

It also describes the advantages and limitations of using multiple indicators as opposed to synthetic indicators. The second part presents the IUNE Observatory as a tool that provides comprehensive and diverse information for monitoring the research activity of Spanish universities.

Five major mechanisms of intervention for pursuing OA policies were used to analyze and evaluate the situation: infrastructure and services; information and dissemination; economic incentives; institutional coordination; and regulation or obligation. Data collection was based on a questionnaire sent to the vice-rectors for research of all Spanish universities. This information was supplemented by consulting directories of repositories, Spanish scientific journals, and institutional OA policies. The application of OA policies varies greatly. Spanish universities can be classified into five groups according to the number and quality of the actions taken. The first includes 7 universities (9% of the total) that have a comprehensive OA policy. The second includes 12 universities (16%) with a clear policy. The third includes 17 universities (23%) with an ongoing policy. The fourth includes 17 universities (23%) that have taken one or two actions and therefore have an incipient policy. Finally, the fifth group includes 21 universities (28%) that have taken no actions to favour OA.

The aim is to raise the visibility of European research in the Humanities and in various areas of the Social Sciences, in order to improve coverage of the cultural and linguistic diversity of our continent. We analyze some of the circumstances affecting the results of the recently updated list of ERIH (' revised '), with special emphasis on the field of education. The results demonstrate the need to improve the criteria for entry into the index (completeness and quality) if ERIH is to achieve its goals.

We take into account the 258 research groups from the University of Murcia as a case study (excluding those from Humanities), in order to delve into the relationship between the size and the scientific performance of research groups, using absolute and relative bibliometric measures. Results point out that groups with more members show higher absolute values of production, visibility and impact as a consequence of their bigger size. Regarding relative indicators, we conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between group size and the share of first quartile publications, as well as with the normalised citation impact. These results are determined by the Social Sciences area, where also per capita output is positively affected by group size. However, no statistical evidence has been found in the other areas regarding the possible influence of group size upon relative indicators. Finally, implications of these results for decision-making in research policy are discussed.

Different parameters are analyzed: institution of origin, number of authors, typology of collaborations and the number and target of references. In order to achieve its objectives, three samples were studied: non-SSCI Spanish journals, SSCI Spanish journals and SSCI international journals. The results reveal a dual behaviour for these authors depending on the national or international destination of their articles. Publishing in an international journal is usually done by authors from younger universities and implies multiple authorship, collaboration with foreign scholars and a high number of references to international journals. Just the contrary can be said of Spanish journals. SSCI Spanish journals are more defined by their nationality than by their inclusion in this internationally prestigious bibliographic index.

Methods: The search was performed in SCI-Expanded and Scopus (key words "smok*" OR "tobac*"). Results: Total annual mean of documents was 41 +/- 12 for WoS vs 60 +/- 16 for Scopus (p = 0.007). The collaboration index (CI) increased during the study period in both databases. The CI annual mean was 9.41 +/- 2.73 in WoS vs 7.12 +/- 1.52 in Scopus (p = 0.029). The number of citations rose over time in both databases, but citations were more recent in Scopus, although the citation/articles index was higher in WoS (14,47 vs 11,50). Conclusions: We found a higher number of journals, articles, signing authors and total citations in Scopus, but the signing authors/articles and institutions/articles indices were higher in WoS. The CI increased annually during the study period in both databases (the CI annual mean was higher in WoS). Citations were higher for older articles but more recent in Scopus (citation/articles index was higher in WoS).

This comparison was performed in order to identify traces of scientific discovery reported by the article even before its reference in the literature. Eighty-nine biomedical articles were manually analyzed. The results indicate that if the contents of the conclusion of an article are poorly represented in the ontology, this may be an indication of a significant discovery. One indication supporting this hypothesis is the fact that the article describing the discovery of the telomerase enzyme dates from 1985, but the term "telomerase" was only included in the MeSH ten years later, in 1995.

Question-answering systems (QA systems) are considered as an alternative to traditional information retrieval systems, because they give correct and understandable answers rather than just offering a list of documents. Four answer search systems available online have been analyzed: START, QuALiM, SEMOTE, and TrueKnowledge. They were analyzed through a wide range of questions that prompted responses of definitions, facts, and closed lists pertaining to different thematic areas. The answers were analyzed using several specific measurements (MRR, TRR, FHS, MAP and precision). The results are encouraging and they show that these systems, although each one different, are potentially valid for precise information retrieval of diverse types and thematic areas.

It compares some of the fields most used by librarians of LILDBI (LILACS Bibliographic Description and Indexing), a component of the LILACS Methodology, with the entities and attributes of the FRBR model. It also outlines the potential benefits that the integration of the FRBR model into the LILACS database could provide to end users: an improved visualization and understanding of bibliographic search/retrieval interfaces.

RFID, with a moderate investment, improve the capabilities of both, librarian and user. This paper presents a new use for RFID to determine where a book is located and the shortest route to it in libraries with multiple levels and rooms. An application named SIGUEME (Sistema Inteligente de GUiado para Entornos Multiusuario Extensos; Intelligent System to Guide for Multiuser Extensive Environments) was implemented experimentally in the Meco's public library (Madrid). The system allows people detection and customized guiding in the building thanks to different screen placed in strategic points. We have developed a wireless communications system based on Zigbee technology that eliminates the need of wires.

It is a simple and intuitive display, similar to a scatterplot, but capturing the multivariate covariance structures between bibliometric indicators. Their interpretation does not require specialized statistical knowledge, but merely to know how to interpret the length of a vector, the angle between two vectors and the distance between two points. With this aim, an analysis has been performed of the scientific output of CSIC's own centres as well as of joint centres during the period 2006-2009, in relation to a series of indicators based on impact and collaboration. Biplot methods are graphical representations of multivariate data. Using HJ-Biplot it is possible to interpret simultaneously the position of the centres, represented by dots; indicators, represented by vectors; and the relationships between them. The position of the centres in the context of their area as well as within the overall CSIC is analysed and those centres with a unique behaviour are identified. We conclude that the Humanities and Social Sciences, and Food Science and Technology are the areas with a greater homogeneous pattern in the performance of their centres, while Physics and Agriculture, are more heterogeneous.

All these changes ranging from the purely terminological to the technical and conceptual are reflected in the scientific collections of different databases. Therefore, a diachronic analysis of this production will permit detection of the transformations produced, as well as the contextualization of this phenomenon from a scientific, social and cultural point of view. This leads to a combination of different tools that allow textual and bibliometric analysis and that produce results that can be extrapolated to similar studies.

Universities included simultaneously in "Academic Ranking of World Universities", in "Times Higher Education Supplement" and in "Webometrics Rankings of World Universities" have been selected. The accessibility assessment has been carried out to check compliance with accessibility guidelines for Web content established by the World Wide Web Consortium recommendation in WCAG 2.0. We have tried to determine whether universities with greater academic prestige have been concerned to provide accesible information about the university through its website so that it can be accessed by everyone (teachers, students), regardless of whether or not the user has a disability.

This analysis shows that the main novelties introduced the second version of the ACADEMIA Program are threefold: 1) the merits are added in large blocks, 2) to avoid the accumulation of merits irrelevant, limiting the number of activities in some sections and, 3) to eliminate the fork between research and knowledge transfer, increasing the potential importance of the relative merits of transfer activities.

The inability to calculate bibliometric indicators to classify and homologate journals according to globally-used quartiles reduces journal visibility. For instance, Colombian journals classified in the National Bibliographic Database Publindex (BBNP) under categories A1, A2, B and C, have low rates of indexing in international databases, such as Web of Science or Scopus, thus limiting the estimation of bibliometric indicators for comparison at an international level. In this case study, articles published between 2003 and 2007 were taken from 211 journals selected from the BBNP-2008. Using Google Scholar, Publish or Perish software and the Scopus database, impact and productivity indicators were quantified and compared creating a regional ranking (Q1-Q4). They were subsequently homologated internationally with the Scimago Journal Ranking (SJR). The h index proved the best indicator to generate the ranking of 170 Colombian journals based on quartiles (Q1-Q4) able to be homologated with SJR quartiles. We propose this methodology for classifying and homologating Latin American journals that are not indexed internationally, as a useful tool for publishers, publishing houses, information agencies and public policy decision-makers concerning education, science and technology, both regionally and globally.

In fact, these formats and displays are responsible for the shifting perceptions of users-consumers concerning how they relate and interact with information. However, in spite of its considerable relevance, the bidirectional relationship between formats/displays and users has been seldom studied.

Recommender systems play a crucial role in this regard, but in many cases the level of customization provided is not enough. This article discusses two key aspects related to the development of recommender systems: proactivity and context-awareness. We propose a theoretical reference model for the creation of proactive recommender systems based on context-awareness information. In addition, we check its feasibility in two real-world scenarios where the model has been successfully implemented: banking and personal learning networks.

Ensuring the success of a product such as a website or a mobile application is not trivial as plenty of factors may have an influence on determining the adequacy of the experience for a given group of users. This paper uses real examples to study the concept of user experience, dealing in depth with the different factors which influence the ultimate success of a product, as well as how they must be taken into account while designing and managing interactive information systems. We also discuss the way they are supported by the different standards to improve user experience.

A high percentage of these journals are published by universities and often as a result of the effort of a small team (e.g., professional association, department, research group). They often have very low numbers of papers published per year, limited impact, and inefficient management, and may find it difficult to overcome a certain image of inbreeding. Against this dominant model, the authors propose the merger, co-publishing or restructuring of current journals to improve their management and achieve greater national and international recognition.

Those who have not yet done so face with concern this unstoppable challenge and are now outlining their own guidelines for social media policies. In an effort to inspire the design of these new policies, this paper aims to approach the recurring topics in the policies already written by leading media such as AP, American Society of News Editors (ASNE), BBC, Bloomberg, Charlotte observer, Freedom communication, Los Angeles times, NPR, Orlando sentinel, Politico, Reuters, Rockford register star, Saint Louis post-dispatch, Source media group, The Denver post, The guardian, The journal gazette, The Manhattan Mercury, The New York times, The Roanoke times, The Wall Street journal y The Washington post. A qualitative content analysis of 22 of these policies has been conducted to identify these topics.

Access has become more important than storage. The web as a tool is leading to the obsolescence of digital media that are just 20 years old and boosts the multimedia possibilities of paper, an analog medium that facilitates the relationship between people and mobile devices.

Between 40 and 50 countries appear in the center of the international network in 2011, and almost all (201) nations are nowadays involved in international collaboration. In this brief communication, we present both a global map with the functionality of a Google Map (zooming, etc.) and network maps based on normalized relations. These maps reveal complementary aspects of the network. International collaboration in the generation of knowledge claims (that is, the context of discovery) changes the structural layering of the sciences. Previously, validation was at the global level and discovery more dependent on local contexts. This changing relationship between the geographical and intellectual dimensions of the sciences also has implications for national science policies.

The study is focused on the University of Vigo. Downloads of the articles distributed by ScienceDirect, SpringerLink and Wiley were analyzed at the University of Vigo (Spain) in the period 2006 to 2011. There is an ascending curve for the consumption of electronic scientific content and a preference for titles distributed by ScienceDirect. The study confirms that experimental and health sciences researchers are the most devoted users, to judge by the number of articles downloaded. Increase in scientific production was also analyzed by discipline. There was a direct correlation between the most productive disciplines and those in which higher numbers of journal articles were downloaded. Nevertheless, no direct correlation was observed between the titles preferred for scientific communication and the titles receiving greater use in the multidisciplinary platforms studied.

We propose an overview of the main areas where this relationship is more intimate and fundamental. To make this overview more comprehensive we will focus on the three functions that Law can exercise over Information: hide, preserve and share. All topics discussed are highly related and the discussion of one has to take into account the other. The good news is that Law has been responding to the needs of the society due to the challenges posed by technological and social changes for millenia and it has the tools to do it again. For this, legal practitioners need the support of information professionals to guide them through all the new phenomena arising from digital information.

The popularization of the Internet's publishing and dissemination tools has multiplied phenomena which previously existed, such as reader participation or narrative extension through transformation of preexisting works. In one way or another, this promotes the audience to the category of (co)authors. Participative or citizen journalism and fanfictions, which have appeared in several media, have produced the so-called transmedia narratives, which present certain legal considerations. This text analyzes the challenges that transmedia narrative has posed to the intellectual property system.

In this paper we describe and analyze the evolution of the different concepts to identify the quality of the interaction on information systems and we help to characterize and locate each quality factor in one dimension and a specific range of the process of use, and consider the relationships and overlap between these concepts.

Memories of the future	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						Digital communication; Society; Social transformation; Information technologies; Digital revolution; Information ecosystem; Social networks; Media; Media ecology		A reflection on the emergence of new forms of interactive digital media in the late twentieth century is proposed. Presented as a historical account written in the future, the main mutations experienced by the media ecosystem from the emergence of digital technologies and global networks are described. From a historical perspective the contemporary period is presented as an unintelligible and often contradictory period similar to other phase transitions, such as the Renaissance (XV-XVI century) or the Industrial Revolution (XVIII-XIX). The text also describes some of the theoretical implications and the most salient debates of that period.

The strategic use of these tools opens new channels to update the business model in the context of restructuring journalism. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the potential of digital tools from the point of view of young people in order to offer to journalistic companies a guideline for action. The methodology used is based on a quantitative survey carried out among people between 16 and 30 years old (N = 549). The results reveal that updating, multimediality, personalization and everyday content that is personally relevant are appreciated as the most important properties. The use of these resources is considered to be one of the pillars that have to be taken into account in order to build the new business model adapted to the digital field.

The essay focuses on the relationship and the synergies between EITB's radio, television and internet newsrooms, by analysing this group's production and distribution model. This study is prompted by the convergent purposes made public by EITB in its most recent Strategic plan (2010-2013) and uses both qualitative (in-depth interviews with managers, ethnographic observation in the newsroom and focus groups) and quantitative (survey of reporters) analyses. The conclusions indicate that EITB is headed toward a cross-media newsroom structure, even though there are still many challenges to face, as a consequence of the strong, established newsroom cultures and the need of promoting further editorial coordination between the three platforms.

Public distrust has led the EU to base their communications strategy on scientific information. In spite of the institutionalization and professionalization of risk communication, the results have not been those foreseen in the new media environment. The explosion of social media or web 2.0 has created digital cultures with new concepts of risks and benefits. For the institutions, the social media add new problems to the traditional communication of risk: they feel obliged to participate in the virtual environment, but at the same time they are afraid to lose control of both the message and legitimacy, and they don't know how to talk to users. Institutions still consider social media as an uncertain opportunity.

The technological revolution, and more specifically the emergence of the Internet, has demonstrated its potential to set up and globalize a set of tools, called social media, able to establish a closer link between the institution and its audience. However, the essence of web 2.0 requires a change in attitude that will eliminate any trace of unidirectionality and allow participation. These requirements affect the configuration of the museum's communication strategy, which should integrate the digital side and keep in mind the particularities derived from it.

To compute the ARWU indicators of these possible groupings, we used the methodology developed in Docampo (2012b). The results of our analysis clearly show the difficulty of improving ranking positions by calculating the sum of aggregated institutions. As a matter of fact, the only way to place a university cluster from Spain in the top 100 would be to treat all of the Catalan universities as a single institution. The next best ranking for Spain would be achieved by the Habitat 5U (universities of Comunidad Valenciana), BKC (Barcelona and Politecnica de Catalunya) and VLC/Campus (Valencia and Politecnica de Valencia), CEls which would lie in the 150-200 range.

Currently, this represents an essential aspect of knowledge organization on the semantic web. After a long period in which thesaurus guidelines and standards were not updated, some have been revised by the governing organisations within the past five years. Consensus among international experts has resulted in publication of the first part of an ISO standard for thesauri, which provides a data model and emphasizes the interoperability process. This paper compiles the most relevant guidelines for thesauri published between the '80s and the ISO 25964 document. We reflect on the most relevant characteristics in this evolution and explore the most recent applications of knowledge organization systems on the Web.

Although this is particularly important to galleries, libraries, archives and museums, the so-called GLAM community, it is of more general relevance, and part of the value of LOD lies in its adoption beyond that community. LOD includes descriptive metadata and vocabulary encoding schemes that are being "skosified" (encoded in the SKOS format) or rendered in OWL (the web ontology language) and made available not only "on" the web, but "for" the semantic web. The paper highlights a few exemplary initiatives in the field. The paper also introduces the HIVE (Helping Interdisciplinary Vocabularies Engineering) framework and discusses the HIVE-ES (Espana) extension for Spanish language vocabularies, leading to a more global approach for linked open vocabularies (LOV).

Controlled vocabularies registered in the The Data Hub catalog of RDF datasets that use SKOS were studied. In addition to establishing a typology of vocabularies, authors analyzed the issues related to open access to data through its direct download, its query through a Sparql endpoint and the existence of appropriate licenses. The existing level of interoperability through the definition of mapping relationships between vocabularies are examined. The study concludes that thesauri and classifications are more integrated into the open data environment while subject headings lists have greater interoperability.

The interest of professionals, academics and researchers has been growing for several years, to the point that it can be stated that knowledge management is a topic on the rise. Nonetheless, if we review their status in organizations, there are great difficulties in their implementation, difficulties that cover various aspects. Through a review of the literature, this paper explores the present gaps in the implementation of KMS. The results reflect the dominance of a reductionist approach in this area, with a focus on IT, revealing the need for a holistic approach, guided by what makes sense in the organization.

Historically, traditional databases were created using bibliographic methods usually carried out by a single institution, but in recent decades multiple libraries have often cooperated to create joint catalogues. This is the case presented in this article which describes the collaboration of 20 Czech special libraries resulting in the creation of a database that contains 162,000 bibliographic records on geographical topics related to the Czech Republic. The project, completed in just four years, initially covered only 20th century materials, however, collaboration with the Temap project has expanded coverage back to early printed books (1450 A.D.). The typology of the documents referenced is broad and includes gray literature. Records are linked to objects (maps, articles, front pages of newspapers) and there are full text links to Google Books. The database has been compared with counterparts in Germany, Poland, and the United States using internationally comparable specific subject headings. The sustainability of Geobibline is ensured by the automatic import of data and their connection with Temap.

A review of the literature shows that this degradation cannot be avoided and that the only solution consists of migrating audiovisual content to digital media. Choosing a digital format for this migration is difficult due to the technical complexity of video formats and to the lack of a specific format aimed at preservation. In this context, the article suggests the use of a model of indicators to evaluate the features of existing digital video formats for their potential use in audiovisual content preservation.

Among them is the university library whose officers occupy a key position that requires them to rethink their professional responsibilities and to adopt a methodology for facilitating the acquisition of the competencies and skills demanded by today's society. A first step for defining the new role of university librarians consists of analyzing the faculty's perceptions of them, in order to plan for the necessary collaboration between the two collectives.

The possibilities for accessing vast quantities of electronic information resources require a better understanding and application of selection and assessment criteria for retrieving high quality information of the greatest relevance to information needs. Given this situation, Ibero-American university libraries-LRCs (Latin-America, Spain and Portugal) have been slowly incorporating information literacy training, such as direct training programs offered by the library or working collaboratively with teaching staff and academic departments concerning curricula for the entire university as a whole or for specific disciplines. Using content analysis, the article reviews information presented on the websites of Spanish university libraries-LRCs about this core training activity, as well as describing and classifying the degree to which information literacy has been implemented.

So much information on any single subject, together with the ease of publishing even further on the same topic, makes it confusing, and even difficult, to know what to look for and what is best suited to the information need in question. One way to address this phenomenon is through infirmation literacy, thus providing mechanisms, strategies and criteria for searching and retrieving information available on the web. The mission statements of some information institutions emphasize the importance of offering information literacy programs for the benefit of their users. From this premise the Information and Knowledge Management Group (GIC) of the Technologies Training Center (FORTES) at the University of Informatics Sciences (UCI), which researches and develops software products related to educational technologies, has developed products and services for improving information literacy among its users. The group has carried out the current research in order to diagnose the state of information literacy among the GIC's users at FORTES.

In this paper we present a critical panorama of the complex system of evaluation, with special attention to research and to the academic fields of Economics and Law. Furthermore, improvements are suggested for increasing the efficiency and transparency of the system. The evaluation of faculty members is fundamental for improving the quality of the Spanish University System. It is also pertinent for making distinctions among members of the community, in an approach towards horizontal promotion through productivity measurements. While this is a polemic topic in the public sector, it is not insurmountable. Data reveal that after the evaluations of the initial years, a serious reflection has begun for improving the system. Specifically, there are suggestions for reducing 'red tape' and increasing the transparency and neutrality of the system.

It includes a study of scientific production in Argentina from 2008 to 2010 in the following areas: Medicine, Physics and Astronomy, Agriculture and Biological sciences, and Social sciences and Humanities. The sample was taken from the Scopus database and the journal access models selected through searches performed using DOAJ, e-revist@s, SciELO, RedALyC, PubMed, Romeo-Sherpa, and Dulcinea. The conclusion of this study is that Argentina offers suitable conditions to provide open access to a high percentage of the scientific literature produced at the national level, using repositories. In addition, the methodology used by the authors could be potentially used by other countries and topic areas. The results provide useful knowledge for repository managers at academic and research institutions to promote repository services development and to justify their maintenance.

If there is an existing relationship we want to know how it works, what the overall effects are, and if these effects create some form of "cannibalization". We studied the leading "free digital" publications in Spain for general information (El mundo), sports (Marca), and economics (Expansion). Sources for extracting data are Introl, OJD and OJD Interact-ilia. Data analysis was based on a descriptive statistics methodology and monthly series over 10 years, starting in June 1998, the first available date for electronic editions of these three newspa-papers. The last month analysed is December 2008 because OJD Interactiva modified its measurement methods in January 2009 and this change could have affected the study results.

The resulting output is then processed by software engineers to design the needed web interface. However, this flow of information is somehow difficult to automate due to the implicit differences in the conceptual level of information processed by each expert. In order to facilitate this flow of information we propose a tool called Interarch, which helps to establish bridges between the information processed by both professionals, automatically creating analysis and design information for software engineers from the content models created by the information professionals.

Since then, scientific publication system has been undergoing a slow transition, though it seems that its destiny is not exactly what was predicted. Now that social sciences are changing the way they disseminate knowledge, becoming increasingly similar to the basic and applied sciences, it is important to consider whether all of those sciences publish in the same way. To answer this, various parameters related to Open Access (OA), e-journals and repositories are studied related to Physics and Chemistry, two disciplines with differences in their publication behaviour and use. From the results, it can be concluded that what differentiates Physics from Chemistry is mainly the success and functionality of their digital repositories, rather than their OA journals.

First, the concept of research data and the related technical difficulties depending on the discipline are reviewed. We also examine the motivations, origins and growth of this movement, which has had an important impact on the scientific community's behaviour through the creation of repositories and data banks, raising both technical and social challenges. Then we discuss leading funding agencies' initiatives and scientific journals' editorial policies promoting these practices. Finally, we examine the impact these major changes in researchers' habits have for librarians, including the emergence of new professional profiles.

J	Galina-Russell, I				Galina-Russell, Isabel			Challenges for the creation of digital resources in the humanities	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						Digital humanities; Digital collections; Electronic resources		The production and use of digital resources is an increasingly important subject within the humanities. Currently significant amounts of resources are invested into digitization projects, databases, websites and other types of digital resources. However, there are few studies that address their production, use and dissemination. The present article introduces the main issues around the production of digital tools and resources as well as the concept of "digital humanities". We present and analyze the results of an initial diagnosis of the digital humanities landscape, taking as a case study the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico - UNAM). These results are discussed and the main challenges and opportunities for the field presented.

This work consists of a descriptive review of the pertinent literature in which the chosen terms are described individually. It aims to transmit scientifically valid information in order to establish a relationship among the three. Three aspects are drawn together in the conceptualization: documents, communication technologies, and people, the combination of which gives rise to a number of strengths that constitute the capital of any organization. This process provides evidence of a strong relationship among record management, information management and knowledge management, which together represent a complementary and indispensable grouping in any organization.

Due to the nonexistence of a system for records and archives management at the Central University "Marta Abreu" of the Villas ( UCLV), Cuba, a diagnostic was performed with the objective of implementing an efficient system to regulate the processes and to allow a control of the documentation. Diverse techniques were used, including interviews, surveys and observations, while bearing in mind the DIRKS methodology ( Designing and Implementing Recordkeeping System). The importance of carrying out a diagnostic is discussed, with references to similar studies. The article concludes by distinguishing between the strengths and weaknesses of records and archives management in this institution, which will serve as a preamble for the execution of the final objective of the investigation.

Three models were selected-black box, chain relations and the recommendations from the 3rd edition of the OECD's Oslo Manual-in order to develop a numerical model for simulating the impact on society of investments in science and technology. Taking into account Mexico's S&T context, the developed model was applied to the region called Queretaro Regional Innovation System (SIRQ). For this system, input-output factors are defined, with numerical values assigned to them based on local conditions. The model is applied by simulating six scenarios for possible development of SIRQ, considering the influence of scientific research and higher education on the region's development.

The Book Citation Index opens a new window of opportunities for analyzing Humanities and Social Sciences from a bibliometric point of view. The main objective of this article is to analyze different impact indicators referred to the scientific publishers included in the Book Citation Index for the Social Sciences and Humanities fields during 2006-2011. This way we construct what we have called the ` Book Publishers Citation Reports'. For this, we present a total of 19 rankings according to the different disciplines in Humanities & Arts and Social Sciences & Law with six indicators for scientific publishers.

The data analysed in this article were taken from the project "The development of the digital media in the American continent, Spain, Portugal and United Kingdom", undertaken by the Universidad del Norte, and also from different indicators available from the World Bank database for each country. These provide information on the development process of the digital media in the Americas, weaknesses regarding penetration, tools for interaction, and personalization of the information published in these media. The data also reveal the segmentation of this development, according to region, with substantial differences among the countries analysed in such aspects as demographic concentration, Internet connectivity, number of users, and percentage of rural population. One important external factor identified was the density of users connected to the Internet.			saide@uninorte.edu.co; jorval2911@yahoo.es						31	0	0	CONSEJO SUPERIOR DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS	MADRID	VITRUVIO 8, 28006 MADRID, SPAIN	0210-0614			REV ESP DOC CIENT	Rev.

Spanish universities represent one sector that has seen significant growth in the use of indicators. These institutions now find themselves in an ever more competitive environment and therefore have a greater need to have knowledge of the performance of their researchers. Against this background, this paper presents a proposal for the creation of Bibliometric Units in Spanish universities and attempts specifically to illustrate both the model and functions of these units based on three pillars: control of information sources related to research, preparing reports, and advice/training. In addition to the theoretical proposal we present different examples from the universities of Navarra and Granada. The text concludes that such units could represent an important opportunity for jobs in the field of Information Science.

Although this kind of resource is of utmost importance for obtaining scientific results, references related to this topic are sparse. The approach proposed by TAIR is novel due to its being based on the daily work of research resources managers and its methodology, on the requirements of technical and administrative staff. Specifically, one could say that the management of research resources is a global process which is set in motion when a public call has been identified. It then proceeds with the grant being awarded, the results published in a scholarly paper, and the citation added to the researchers' CVs. In conclusion, this article recommends that the management of research resources should be a full process integrated into academic production by means of the TAIR software.

Although there has been broad coverage of indicators for library evaluation, little has been produced about libraries attached to centres of high technology, such as biotechnology. The aim of this paper is to analyse the current situation of performance evaluations in 22 libraries of Cuban biotechnology research centres. The data introduced were gathered from a survey inquiring in to the use by library staff of this kind of study and the importance attached to it. The outputs of this paper could contribute to the development of performance indicators for libraries belonging to R&D centres. The outcome will also be useful for furthering comparative studies among different types of libraries.

This effect, also known as cumulative advantage, contributes to skewing the unequal distribution of both production and impact among scientists. This paper focuses on determining whether the cumulative advantage is present within a sample of 174 Spanish scientists doing research in four major areas (i.e.: physics, chemistry, biology and biochemistry). In order to determine the impact of their careers in research, we specify a multi-equational model. Among other variables, we include those related with their doctoral training, the postdoctoral period and the quality of the departments where scientists are hired after they finish their post doctoral work. Moreover, the model includes a group of hypotheses gathered from a survey of the literature on this topic. The model is based on the Path Analysis technique. We also have developed a method to determine the quality of academic departments using a single scale suitable for any country and discipline. The main result confirms the existence of cumulative advantage being the predoctoral productivity the main determinant of productivity during the ten years after obtaining the doctor degree. Finally, a bias in productivity and impact in favour of men is observed.

Based on a study of the characteristics of the websites of the major news media, this article proposes a specific methodology for the evaluation of this sort of website. The proposed methodology consists of thirty-six indicators, organized around eight parameters that evaluate, mainly, the degree of adaptation of the media to Web 2.0 interaction. Apart from that, other aspects are evaluated, such as information architecture, accessibility, usability and the interaction and communication tools offered to users.

The article examines science policies in Spain together with the investments in economic and human resources devoted to research, and their effects on the internationalization process. Scholarly research in Spain has become increasingly international over the last three decades. The main features of this process have been a linear growth of productivity in terms of the number of papers published per year; a progressive growth -with a dramatic increase in the 2000's- of internationally coauthored papers, with a notable focus on European countries, although the United States remains Spain's main collaborator country; and the hegemony of the English language for scientific publications.

Various methodologies using indicators for the evaluation of universities have been proposed in the professional literature and there is intense debate over which are the most appropriate. Therefore, it is necessary to establish criteria against which to judge the existing indicators. This paper contributes directly to both theory and practice by providing a list of prioritized critical indicators for the evaluation of higher education institutions. For that purpose, we use the Delphi technique to try to achieve some sort of consensus among a group of experts with in-depth knowledge of higher education evaluation. Our results show that among the panel of experts there is no consensus and no clear cut division on the identification of which indicators are the most effective for the evaluation of university missions, the type of indicator and their degree of importance in the evaluation process.

A new generation of digital services platforms for libraries is emerging, designed to provide a more comprehensive approach to the management and access to all formats of library materials: print, electronic and digital. These new systems involve a modernization of technology, embracing service-oriented architectures, availability for APIs to facilitate interoperability with external systems, support for task workflows more aligned with current operational realities, and more tightly coupled discovery interfaces that deliver access to library collections and services in a more unified and comprehensive manner. These new products, emerging in this era of cloud computing, have been designed for deployment through software as a service and rely on highly shared data models.

However, QA systems should be adapted to restricted domains for the sake of precision. This adaptation is not a trivial task, since several heterogeneous resources related to a restricted domain must be integrated into existing QA systems. This paper presents the Maraqa tool, whose novelty is the use of software engineering techniques such as model driven development to automate the adaptation process. It is worth noting that Maraqa has been evaluated through a set of experiments (within the agricultural domain) that demonstrate its applicability: the precision of the adapted QA system showed 29.5% improvement.

This makes it possible to compare publication trends for China, the USA, EU-27, and smaller countries with the data in the Scopus (Elsevier) database. China no longer grew exponentially during the 2000s, but linearly. Contrary to previous predictions on the basis of exponential growth, the cross-over of the lines for China and the USA is postponed to the next decade (after 2020) according to this data. These long extrapolations, however, should be used only as indicators and not as predictions. Uncertainty in trends can be specified using the coefficient of determination of the regression (R-2) and confidence intervals. Along with the dynamics in the publication trends, one also has to take into account the dynamics of the databases used for the measurement.

The search for information has been one of the most affected areas, with the emergence of news sources 2.0, such as blogs and social networks. Despite the apparent value of these new sources of information, what practical use and credibility do Portuguese and Spanish journalists give to these sources? In this paper we define what kind of tools can be considered "2.0 sources" and the ways in which these journalists consider them credible and reliable. The results show that the journalists from both countries are using the internet daily to find material for their work, get factual information, receive and send information and verify it, but still have little confidence in the 2.0 sources.

Then it focuses on the two distinct views regarding net neutrality: the Openists, supporters of an open net without restrictions, on one side and Deregulationists, naturally suspicious of any government regulation, on the other. Finally, this article describes the net neutrality regulatory framework within the European Union.

This has not been the case a: an international level, where various international conferences have been organized to update this discipline. While the attempt was noteworthy, in the current context of web 2.0 the concept does not seem justified. The traditional differentiating features used by the proponents of this idea, and many of those that have been added over time, have become obsolete.

As a result, on numerous occasions a system is used, and even recommended, without knowledge of its functions and the adequacy of its search algorithm. An analysis was conducted to better understand the specifics of the search engines specialized in health sciences freely accessible via the internet, to assess for quality and determine which ones offer the best results.

Given the relevance of the user-generated content in such a scenario and its essentially relational nature, successfully locating the best sources of information requires the development of recommender systems that incorporate the social characteristic of scenarios built on a network that goes beyond the original Internet. The article provides a review of current approaches to the process of recommendation, placing them in the context of consolidated trends associated with the phenomenon of Social Computing, and highlights some lines of development in the area of redefining the problem of recommendation in a context dominated by social networks and user-generated content.

Likewise, some enterprises are beginning to use them to support their business process. However, one part of the society has the impression that these are just a waste of time. Despite this, studies have shown that, properly used, social networks can have great benefits, such as the development of information literacy, access to information repositories and the development of social capital. Being a digital native does not guarantee that university students will be able to obtain these benefits. Teachers and universities in general, rather than block student access to these networks, must concern themselves with developing the necessary information literacy to produce healthy informivores.

Now that BiblogTecarios has 40 blogs, communication tools are essential for the proper functioning of the website, as well as the desire to work on a joint (collaborative and cooperative) project. Crowdsourcing, or the collective intelligence of its members, helped this project to grow; personal connections and collective work are the key pillars for its continued growth.

Various bibliometric analyses of the different rankings are also shown. Firstly, the updated data for the rankings on 12 scientific fields for the 2006-2010 period are presented focusing on the changes in the positions compared to the 2005-2009 period. Secondly, we present the results in the scientific disciplines during the 2006-2010 period, on the one hand for the Spanish university system as a whole, and on the other hand showing the major universities in 19 new disciplines.

Besides, universities increasingly apply management tools and techniques coming from the business field. On the other hand, in recent years universities have perceived an environmental pressure as a consequence of a) their implication in regional development where they are located, and b) their need to reform their program offerings according to the needs of society and the requirements of the labour market, as well as a result of the process of adapting their degrees to the European Higher Education Area (Bologna process). This paper describes and characterises Cl practices in the universities and analyses the Cl contribution to the design of degree courses. The research is based on qualitative methods, and data were collected through interviews. Results suggest that the use of Cl in universities is mainly reactive, and addressed only to organisational tactics.

The emergence of social media monitoring companies has brought a new job market for information professionals, to the extent that this information has to be collected and processed, and new automated monitoring systems have to be developed.

For example, information, comments and links that are shared by users belonging to a certain community e. g., linguistic, social, thematic, organizational- are analyzed in real time to obtain trends at specified intervals (e. g., hourly, daily, weekly...). By means of simplicity search algorithms, the information flow becomes an automated news bulletin with its own value but to which opinions and the relevance that users of social networks give them are added. Umap opens the way for future applications centred in the extraction of information and collective intelligence from communities that share social, political, economical, trading, business, products, brand, technological and other interests through social networks.

The large-scale generation of online information is the result of collective social action based on information: infosociability. Competitive Intelligence (Cl) aims to monitor and research a company's web 2.0 environment for information relevant to its decision-making process. Facing the possibilities and limitations that today's technology offers for processing the communication of meanings and abstract ideas in text format, a methodology derived from empirical research on web 2.0 is proposed. Monitoring and research are identified as the two key processes that generate insights aimed to facilitate decision-making. The relevance of each stage is illustrated with reference to the diverse methodological challenges encountered while extracting and analyzing large amounts of online information.

Some collections exist in media formats that are now difficult to reproduce, as in this project at the University of Alicante. Radio broadcasts preserved on open-reel tapes require technology that has already disappeared, and the reproduction of the original source involves progressive destruction.

Given the present availability of various journal evaluation systems in Spain, MIAR could evolve into a collaborative portal where stakeholders can share the main features of the journals in which they participate directly or indirectly. The project would use social networks, voting and commenting systems, and technologies like open linked data, thus enabling a greater dissemination and socialization of the data collected for each publication. In this way data could be better used by the three most directly concerned groups: referees, publishers and authors/readers.

J	Fontanelle, L				Fontanelle, Lee			In search of lost time	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						Photographic collections; Photographic archives; Criteria for organizing archives; Researchers' needs; United States; Spain; History of photography		Personal impressions of working in photographic archives are presented here from the viewpoint of the researcher in photography, specifically one who has used these stores of material in several countries. The writer's many years of experience permits an assessment of the evolution undergone by institutions that house these materials. After noting the beginnings of studies in photographic history and the first periodical publications in this area, the analysis focuses on how materials are organized from the user's point of view. The early definition of photographic archives rested in organizations' interest in constructing their own histories, and therefore the archives were organized by local topics or sites. Photography was considered as auxiliary to history. On the other hand, the historian of photography has other needs in the study of photography from an artistic, biographic, or technical angle. Some of the world's great museum-quality collections are treated in this way -less subjectively- and several cases are described in which the author participated in their assessment and organization based on photographers, facts, or contexts that fell under the heading "Spain", although not always involving works by Spaniards, strictly speaking. The author also describes the experience of consulting photographic archives prior to and in the early years of democracy in Spain; later on, a surge of concern emerged in Spain for both public and private photographic collections. Finally, technical considerations such as the access to, treatment and conservation of archives are touched upon from the viewpoint of firsthand experience with institutional archives.

The online presence of this photographic heritage is assessed on the basis of the 26 Catalan institutions that manage photography archives and either make photographs available on the network or have started digitization projects that now include at least 5,000 digitized images. Of these 26 entities, 15 offer Internet access to their collection of photographs, with a total of more than 250,000 photographs available. The study details the total size of each collection, number of digitized images, and how many of these images are available online. The difference between digitized images and images available online is explained by the difficulties encountered in digitizing, cataloguing, and publishing the images online with the appropriate software and managing copyright issues related to the photographs.

The so-called web 2.0 has enabled a new context for these institutions to present their collections and activities to new users. The social networks have also allowed the exploration of new strategies for dissemination and communication. Flickr: The Commons project, jointly developed by the Library of Congress and Flickr's photosharing and hosting platform, offers an attractive perspective for many of these institutions to enlarge the possibilities of indexing and of online communities research. This article presents the characteristics of the project, the strategies outlined by each participating institution and an evaluation of the results.

First we discuss the stages of e-government models that are currently in use and discuss the main characteristics and applications. The different e-government benchmarking approaches are analysed, pointing out that e-administration is the more benchmarked e-government area. A more in-depth analysis of the most relevant benchmarks is performed. Both analyses reveal several limitations of existing studies with respect to applicability to local administration. These include the scarcity of studies focused on this area, the extent of adoption of public services and the use of models of evolution of e-government that do not reflect the new trends in the provision of services. Finally we point out improvements to be made in future benchmarking of electronic services to increase their applicability in the field of local administration.

We present one of the key points that are being used to achieve this objective of participation: the open data movement. In Europe, its origins lie in the issuance of Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on access to and reuse of public sector information. Open data projects described here provide access to government data according to the recommendations of the W3C. The structure and open format allows data to be reused to provide new services to citizens and businesses. Numerous projects and visualization applications have been developed that realize the potential of this movement. The situation in Spain is emerging and even in a short period of time many initiatives are maturing. This offers us the opportunity to ask what role information managers will take on in this new scenario.

The European authorities are promoting public information reuse policies as a pillar for the digital economy and for democratic transparency. In the same way, several public and private reuse initiatives in Spain have sprung up in recent years to maximize public information reuse benefits. In this sense, the Aporta Project, supported by the Spanish Ministry for Territorial Cooperation and Public Administration and the Ministry for Industry, Trade and Commerce, have been working since 2009 in promoting reuse in Spain. Regarding the challenges of the actual reuse policies it is important to point out that a Royal decree that develops the Spanish Reuse Law is being drafted with the aim to solve some indeterminate aspects of the present public information reuse law.			carlos.marcos@mpt.es; slsoriono@mityc.es						0	3	3	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inf.

They make use of the so-called official publications to disseminate information about public policies. We use the term publications in the sense that this word has attained in the digital era, that is, any digital resource online, including web pages from departments. The Spanish Administration provides two key elements of information about its publishing activity: the Catalogue of Publications of the General Administration of the State and the Guide to official publishers. The organizational developments for preserving and reuse the valuable and extensive information of the Spanish Public Sector are still pending, but the current regulatory gaps are in the process of being resolved.

It involves the improvement of processes of prescribing and dispensing pharmacotherapy and the coordination of health professionals. Also, for patients with long-term treatments, the system helps to reduce the frequency of primary care center visits and improves patient safety by reducing mistakes in prescriptions written by hand. The system requires the interconnection and functioning of many information systems to be integrated and work well together with the infrastructure of the data processing center that is responsible for distributing information to all healthcare centers. In this way, improvements of the electronic prescription system on healthcare will be analyzed (decrease of physician visits, reduction in medical errors, increase in therapeutic compliance by patients).

This mechanism allows us to host more than one virtual computer in just one actual computer. An intranet is made up of a set of computers running as servers that are underutilized for the most part. In this paper we want to show virtualization as a tool allowing us to have a more efficient intranet because it helps us reduce the number of computers in the net; more secure because it allows the creation of backup copies automatically; and easier to manage because we centralize all our services with a handful of servers. With all this, virtualization allows hardware, electricity and maintenance savings.

The creation of systems to protect the files, the emergence of national and international agencies to monitor illegal downloads, and the publishing industry's reluctance to abandon the paper and embrace the digital formats, provide the context for a practice that is little studied when it comes to books. The aim of this paper is to analyze the conditions under which it occurs in Spain, examining the legal provision of content, and the availability of works in p2p networks and blogs. The hypothesis is that in the book arena, the content downloads do not have the relevance and scale they possess in music or film, and that in large part they are motivated by the lack of a legal offering that is varied and up-to-date, and by deficiencies in the sales and distribution platforms. The presence of the bestselling books in major sales platforms and in different file sharing networks is analyzed.

The most common practice is peer review, in which several experts determine the reliability of the ideas and results as well as the potential impact on science. Studying the documentation provided by the editors of Quality Assessment of Spanish Scientific Journals, 1st Edition, in 2008, we have analyzed some of the editorial practices in the evaluation process, such as external evaluation, instructions to referees, the existence of protocols to evaluate the articles and anonymity of those involved in the review. The significance of our work is that the evaluation process has been checked independently of what is stated in the journal. We have verified that there is a lack of standardization in the evaluation process, which is symptomatic of the need for deeper professionalization.

The ECT is organized into communities, understood as sets of people with a common interest who share a space with its own information and collaboration tools. This space is managed and powered autonomously by the communities themselves. This paper analyzes the use and degree of implementation of the ECT, considering the user communities and activity statistics in 2009 and 2010. From the data obtained we deduce that instrumental services have easier acceptance than collaboration and knowledge management services; content generation is focused on a small number of users; and communities associated with organizational units have less development than those associated with work areas or projects.

Internal communications in public and private organizations are alive, and their flows of interaction between internal and external members of the organization are becoming more intense. Tools capable of handling large volumes of information in an easy, fast and secure manner are needed. This is where Zyncro appears: as the new intranet 2.0. This article analyzes and describes this new online application with special emphasis on its archiving and documentation function articulated through working groups and personal archives.

The truth, however, is that it is quite the opposite of what was promised, and we are increasingly becoming aware of the antagonistic effects that this speed without any purpose imposes upon our senses, our capacity for concentration and understanding, and our perception of the weight and importance of the moment.			futurosdellibro@gmail.com						19	1	1	EPI	BARCELONA	APARTADO 32 280, BARCELONA, 08080, SPAIN	1386-6710			PROF INFORM	Prof. Inf.

Traditionally this area, so important in all the teaching of communication, has been a drag on the learning process of students who don't see it as a versatile and useful subject that will guarantee the quality of their work. For this reason we designed a paired course with Informative and Audiovisual Genres, in the same program. Between the two classes, students completed a final project, a report developed for different media: press, radio and TV. The organization of all of the information and its sources came together in the creation of blogs that stored all of the material as it was collected.

Its concept, history and criticism are presented. Thereafter, the pyramid is enriched with the contributions of cognitive sciences in the last decades, and an enlarged model is proposed. Finally, a discussion of the different levels of the pyramid is presented from the point of view of the architecture of the human information system: data, information, knowledge and wisdom. As a result of very different points of view, the model is full of ambiguities and alternative interpretations, but nevertheless remains a fertile metaphor and a point of reference for the intra-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary dialog at the maximum level of abstraction.

The sample consisted of 120 students from 7 schools ("liceos") in Chile, whose average age was 15. The participants had to carry out two different tasks on the Internet: first, a vertical communication activity (Google search); second, a horizontal communication activity (messaging). In each task, the perceived elapsed time and the level of interest were evaluated. When comparing the vertical and the horizontal communication activities, the results show a significantly higher interest and significantly lower estimated time in the horizontal communication task (chatting). From these results, a projection of the informational and educational uses of the internet can be made.

The data show that young people use the internet mainly in informal and private spaces and, to a lesser extent, in formal educational environments. For this population group, the internet is used and is worth exploring to the extent that the information found is useful for social and leisure purposes, while educational benefits are taken for granted.

This work is part of a bigger project, "Cybermedia in Colombia and Latin America", which is being coordinated by the Universidad del Norte (Colombia), with the recent support of the Universidad de los Andes (Venezuela). For the empirical research, we applied the model proposed by Rodriguez-Martinez, Codina y Pedraza-Jimenez (2010), with the further objective of building an indicator to measure the development of Colombian online newspapers. The results show that these digital media have low levels of accessibility, visibility and popularity, and therefore low use of tools for interaction, in-depth exploration and personalization of contents. The study concludes with a quality ranking of cybermedia in Colombia.

J	Sturges, P				Sturges, Paul			Mystery and transparency: access to information in the domains of religion and science	PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION			Spanish	Article						Access to information; Freedom of expression; Scientific method; Transparency; Censorship; Blasphemy		Whilst science and religion are arguably compatible as two methods to identify truth, in practice they are divergent in their effects. This has serious implications for the theory and practice of library and information work. By starting with the human right of freedom of expression (which contains the right of freedom of access to information) it is possible to compare religion and science and their tendency towards mystery or transparency. The scientific method is inherently sceptical, testing hypotheses with openly exposed methods and results. Although the purity of science is sometimes reduced by its paymasters (governments, corporations and foundations) and by the scientific establishment itself, it offers a model of transparency. Religion is based on faith in some form of revelation, often encapsulated in a book or books, against which knowledge is tested. In practice this preference for authority and mystery encourages the forceful rejection of ideas and fosters secrecy both intellectual and organisational. It is suggested here that libraries are institutions that expose ideas for public use and that they are therefore part of the scientific project. The censorship and suppression of ideas associated with religion needs to be resisted by library and information professionals in whatever form, such as a resurgent emphasis on protection of religion through blasphemy laws, that this tendency manifests itself.

The study was based on the rankings of researcher included in the Indice de Impact de las Revistas Espanolas de Ciencias Sociales (INRECS) and Indice de Impacto de las Revistas Espanolas de Ciencias Juridicas (INRECJ). Eleven different scientific disciplines were analyzed and the final sample consisted of 3,370 researchers, of whom 30% were women. To study gender differences four variables were selected and analyzed: number of papers, number of citations, number of international citations and citation average. The results show that women in the 11 areas studied have both a lower productivity and a lower number of citations. On the other hand, in some areas women do receive a greater number of international citations and in almost all areas achieve higher citation averages. However the presence of women in the rankings and among the Spanish research elite is still small.

The systematic structure of a thesaurus: indicators for quality assessment	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						Indicators; quality; systematic structure; thesauri		Four indicators are proposed to assess the quality of a thesaurus' systematic structure. This proposal considers that the specifications included in thesauri design and development standards, together with the principles of classification theory, represent the quality requirements to be met by the inherent characteristics of a thesaurus. The characteristics that do not meet the requirements are considered nonconformities. Four indicators are proposed to measure nonconformities, and were tested in three thesauri in Spanish. The results (i.e., nonconformities) were: V Percentage of preferred terms designating more than one concept: 10,8% for DeCS, 7,3% Spines and 10,9% Unesco. 2) Percentage of preferred terms without a hierarchical relation: 0 DeCS, 1,4% Spines and 1,1% Unesco. 3) Percentage of preferred terms with more than one broader term: 53,8% DeCS, 14,9% Spines, 0 Unesco. 4) Percentage of preferred terms with only one narrower term: 13,5% DeCS, 3,5% Spines, 10,3% Unesco. We conclude that the proposed indicators can be useful for assessing the quality of a thesaurus' systematic structure during the design and development processes.

The study is based on a questionnaire sent to 1,025 randomly selected university students. The results obtained suggest that university students consider themselves, in general terms, competent in using the Internet for searching information for academic purposes, but not in using libraries for the same purpose. Logically, the frequency of Internet usage is also far superior to that of other resources used to search for academic information. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to improve the documentation skills rind strategies for students' use of libraries. This should not exclude the use of the Internet, but rather complement it for enhancing search results in regards to rigor; reliability and the potential to cover informational needs of an academic nature.

The application of sensors permits for full, accurate and secure monitoring of environmental conditions and allows for the prediction of chemical-physical mechanisms of degradation, as well as of the most suitable procedures for controlling them. The sensors used in the present study were prepared by the sol-gel method and change colour when variations in the evaluated parameters occur All of the sensors are reversible, reusable and can be regenerated. Temperature, relative humidity, illumination and acidity were the parameters evaluated. In the first stage, conventional apparatus were used to determine the critical ranges of variation for such parameters. Subsequently optical sensors sensitive in such ranges were designed and prepared. These sensors were calibrated and distributed throughout the rooms containing the holdings (approximately 3.200 square meters). The optical response of the sensors (change of colour) was recorded by visible spectrophotometry during the spring and summer of 2009. The use of sensors has the following advantages: low cost, no need for wires or apparatus during exposure, small size, reversibility, and short response time. The resulting data have revealed the environmental conditions of the conservation of the holdings, including environmental acidity, a parameter that could not be evaluated previously through conventional procedures.

The information sources used to identify and select each journal were the databases of Web of Science, in particular Arts & Humanities Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index. The analysis checked 30 parameters structured in a Data Collection Sheet (DCS), which were taken from the revised assessment criteria proposed by Delgado and others (2007). In general, these journals have a low average of reported informational parameters. Of all the journals that make up the Humanities' area, informational parameters about peer review editorial practices mentioned average 5.6%. As for the 58 journals comprising the Social Sciences, their average for the cited parameters was 9.7%. We conclude this study by providing a range of measures for their improvement and further alignment with the patterns of scholarly communication.

The aim of the project, financed by the Ministry of Education, was to propose a model of indicators for information literacy competency for school libraries. In considering information literacy as a competency for knowing and learning via networks, and the school library as a Teaching and Learning Resource Center, the authors propose a design for qualitative indicators to measure the progress and quality of information literacy programs in school libraries. The design of the model of indicators is presented, with the model categorized according to skills, abilities and competencies. These criteria were introduced into a questionnaire based on educational levels and covering selected digital resources. The applicability of this tool was tested in Asturias, Navarre and Madrid. The application of the questionnaire in these three regions of Spain, the nature of the questions, the processing of the resulting data, and an initial interpretative analysis by educational levels are described. Finally some initial conclusions are put forward for a future project, as are recommendations for developing a Knowledge Society beginning with an effective plan for information literacy programs in school libraries to be transformed into Teaching and Learning Resource Centers.

This has created the need for a thorough analysis of professional profiles related to the fields of Advertising and Public Relations, Journalism, and Audiovisual Communication. This work purports to identify existing research studies focused on this subject. For this study we have carried out a systematic review of articles, books and doctoral theses dealing with communications-related professions that have been indexed in the databases of ISOC, ISBN and TESEO from the 1970s through 2009. We have extracted bibliometric indicators and adopted the evaluation criteria utilized by CNEAI (Spanish National Commission for the Evaluation of Research Activity) and ANECA (National Agency for Quality Assessment and Accreditation of Spain). The results appear to indicate that the signing of the Bologna Declaration has drawn more attention to communications-related professions. Journalism has been the profession most specifically studied. The majority of studies across the board do not meet the quality criteria set by the evaluation agencies. Overall, we observe that there is an obvious need to improve both the quantity and quality of related research, as well as to strengthen the training of researchers in social research methodology.

For each root domain, two different networks are extracted: the first being the domain network and the second, the page network. In each case, a series of indicators taken from social network analysis is evaluated in order to characterize the website structure. Factor analysis may provide an appropriate statistical methodology for extracting in graphic form the principal profile of the website in terms of its internal structure. However, the large number of indicators generated by such an exploratory search would lead to a prohibitive number of possibilities. Therefore, this work proposes the use of genetic algorithms. By using this guided search over a given space of possible solutions, genetic algorithms can provide a subset of indicators able to optimize a fitness function. The results categorize corporate websites in terms of their link structure and highlight the possibilities for using genetic algorithms as a tool for knowledge discovery.

A possible way to avoid this problem is to apply high dynamic range (HDR) techniques based on multiple exposures. If these techniques prove to be suitable for the digitization of documents in the context of cultural heritage, it should be possible to obtain high quality digital captures while employing lower cost equipment, affordable enough for institutions with limited resources. In this paper we offer a theoretical and experimental approach to the concept and methods involved in the quality assessment of document digitization, the impact of dynamic range on image quality, and the viability of HDR techniques in the context of cultural heritage.

Different aspects were analysed: time pattern, journals, authorship and author affiliation. Also examined were the books reviewed, by publication type, language, authorship, publisher and time lag between the books' publication and the appearance of the reviews. The results concerning the reviews show a constant reduction in their production and a large number concentrated in the humanities. Authors are mostly Spaniards and university lecturers, who publish alone and have a very low level of productivity. There is also a high level of endogamy among those authors who are members of editorial boards. The results concerning the reviewed books reveal that few titles were reviewed more than once, there are a large number of monographs, mostly in Spanish, and there is a long time lag between a book's publication and the appearance of its review.

The Web of Science (WoS) databases were examined for the years 2003-2006, in order to explore the possible differences between biotechnology research teams in Madrid according to their specialization profile. This Spanish region has the highest output in biotechnology (27 %), a category that interacts with other disciplines, such as microbiology, biochemistry and food science. For this reason, the study of teams includes, in a second analysis, not just the documents in this category, but also publications of the team leaders, regardless of their discipline. With these data, the influence of the specialization on the teams' characteristics, collaboration patterns and impact is discussed. Three typologies are identified according to sub-specialities: a) CORE teams (publishing 50 % or more in biotechnology); b) BASIC teams (publishing in biochemistry and other basic disciplines); and c) MEDIUM teams (publishing in food science and other less basic disciplines). By means of statistical tests, significant differences in output and impact were found among them. The article concludes that these disparities should be taken into account when assessing categories of interdisciplinary research such as biotechnology.

J	Carrera-Gallissa, E; Capdevila, X				Carrera-Gallissa, Enric; Capdevila, Xavier			Textile-related research in Spain: a case study applying micro bibliometric indicators	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						h Index; Spain; Textile researchers; Bibliometrics indicators	H-INDEX; JOURNALS	The study examines the h-index of textile researchers in Spain and, for the first time, provides information, on the range of values of this index in the area of textile-related knowledge. This paper reports on a study of 10 scientific production indicators for Spanish textile researchers over the period 1955-2009. The population studied consisted of 73 researchers affiliated with 6 different institutions. Textile investigators represent a heterogeneous community, since they come from different areas of knowledge. The h-index studied presents a positive correlation, ranging between intense and notable, with the number of publications, publications by year, number of citations, citations per year, number of citations received by the most cited publication. The correlation is significant but negative concerning the percentage of authors' non-cited publications. The Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientficas (CSIC) has higher levels than the other institutions for the following indicators: h-index, number of publications, citations, citation per year, maximum number of citations. The Instituto Tecnologico Textil de Alcoy (AITEX) has the highest levels for the following indicators: h-index per year of activity and percentage of non-cited publications. Finally, a relation is shown between the h-index and three (latent) factors that explain the other indicators and provide three dimensions of the h-index.

This research, while traditionally used in teacher education, is currently becoming enormously important since it should be carried out both before and after educational reforms. The purpose of this study is to map the development of action research in teacher education through articles published in Spanish education journals. The research uses a survey approach and applies a documentary methodology. The results show how productive this line of research has been throughout its evolution, provide a database of all the articles, and offer a view of the personal, social and cognitive dimensions of this line of research: collaboration in publications, the most productive authors, research teams, main institutions performing the studies, specific journals dedicated to this line of research, main topics studied, and epistemological approaches, among others.

No single reason explains this situation. On the contrary, a set of complex and interrelated causes can be found. On the supply side, the potential hurdles are in the technical (infrastructures, standards), economic (revenue models, content availability) and normative domains. On the demand side, companies must understand the (real) utility derived by consumers and the circumstances in which they intend to use the service. The conditions for mobile television success are, therefore, the research question of this paper It is concluded that removal of these barriers, focus on the user (rather than on the product), and stronger institutional commitment are key factors for mobile television development.

Audiences can participate even before the news happens, at planning the agenda or looking for sources. In this sense, the real convergence of digital media is not with the platforms, but with their audiences. The specific debate about what a digital newsroom must be is the main issue discussed in this article, that shows a general overview from the first initiatives in the USA to the latest actions in Spain, and from models closer to "reality journalism" to other open projects such as the "Google newsroom".

The main objective of CIRC (in Spanish, "Clasificacion integrada de revistas cientificas") is to become a tool to obtain bibliometrics indicators for different levels of aggregation based on the quality of publications. The ranking is the result of consensus of experts in the field of bibliometrics and research evaluation. The resulting classification consists of four groups of journals (gA, gB, gC, gD) configured according to the visibility of the journals; a fifth group of excellence was created with the most relevant journals (gEx). To create groups and determine quality of the journals, various lists and databases referenced in Cneai and Aneca standards were used. Finally, we illustrate the use of CIRC applying it to the scientific production of the departments of Social Sciences at the University of Granada.

Based on data obtained from Yahoo Site Explorer, the study found that overall the number of links received, or backlinks, had increased by 326.28%. As compared to a referenced group of websites, this represents a very important increase. Additionally, Catalan museum websites were compared to two control groups: websites of the major European museums and websites with a museum domain that are best positioned in Google and Yahoo. The results show that the best Catalan museum websites have attained a good visibility level internationally, although they still remain at a considerable distance from the best museums in Europe.

J	Fernandez-Quijada, D				Fernandez-Quijada, David			The profile of Spanish journals in the field of communication (2007-2008)	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						Bibliometrics; scholarly production; scholarly journals; communication studies; social network analysis	ELECTRONIC-MEDIA; BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS; CITATION; PRODUCTIVITY; PUBLICATION; BUSINESS	The evolution of parameters for scholarly publications and of academic requirements in Spain has resulted in changes to scholarly journals, among others, those in the field of communication sciences. This article characterizes the core Spanish communication journals according to variables such as the number of published articles, language, author institution and collaboration networks, and citation patterns during 2007-2008. By applying bibliometric techniques and social network analysis, a profile showing similarities and differences among the journals is obtained, as well as a profile of the overall system.

This paper examines productivity and chronological distribution, national and international collaboration, scientific production by departments, and the journals in which articles were published. The results reveal a slight increase in productivity, as well as a slightly higher level of co-authorship (2.85) than the average for social sciences in Spain, along with a good level of collaboration with national and foreign academic institutions.

J	Edo-Hernandez, V				Edo-Hernandez, Valentin			Subject Classifications in Economics: Critical assessment and proposal for a general basic alternative	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE DOCUMENTACION CIENTIFICA			Spanish	Article						Subject classification; economics subjects; economic literature; document searches; indexing		This paper assesses the main subject classifications currently used in economics -Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) and Journal of Economic Literature classification (JEL)-, offers a design for a methodological procedure, and proposes a new subject classification. The new system was developed under the principles of comprehensiveness, universality, terminological accuracy, clarity in conceptual demarcations, simplicity, currency, and appropriateness to the subject divisions commonly used by economists. The proposed classification is developed only to the second hierarchical level, has 40 basic subject divisions and is innovative, although it maintains a close relationship to the main current classifications -UDC and JEL- as well as to the fields of knowledge defined by teaching and research programs in Spanish universities. Its aim is to improve the quality and efficiency of document handling and the effectiveness of the overall information system and, as such, assists two types of users: those who deal with bibliographic manterial on Economics by improving the speed and quality of their work (of organization, classification, indexing, etc.) and those who perform searches by facilitating the use and choice of subject terms and improving the accuracy of their search results.

The work attempted to identify how many women became large producers of scholarly articles compared to those who did not reach the same levels of productivity and impact. A total of 3,739 articles were retrieved during this period and the gender of all authors with more than 2 articles was identified. Of these authors 2,774 (60.41%) were male and 1,818 (39.59%) were female. Focusing solely on large producers, the percentage of women publishing more than 10 papers was reduced to 26.72%. As regards to scientific collaboration, it is significant to note that women are included in all clusters of at least 10 authors and in some cases their presence is comparable with that of men. Although women's participation is lower than men's in all areas of knowledge, it is noteworthy that in Health Sciences the difference is not as great as in other technical areas. Women's contribution to the scientific field is increasing, suggesting the possibility of a significant improvement in gender parity in the coining years.
