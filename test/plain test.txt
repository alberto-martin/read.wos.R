AB Mung bean starch water suspension (20%, w/w) was subjected to high pressure at 120, 240, 360, 480, and 600 MPa for 30 min, and the rheological properties were investigated by a rheometer. The storage modulus and loss modulus increased with the increased pressure. The HHP-treated mung bean starch were weak gels; their rigidity and viscoelasticity increased with the increased pressure. Pressurized mung bean starch gels were pseudoplastic non-Newtonian fluids and displayed shear thinning. The rheogram fitted the power-law model adequately. The mung bean starch gels were thixotropic. The hysteresis loop area of mung bean starch gel treated by 480 MPa was the highest.

AB B3LYP/6-311+G* calculations were performed on five phenolic pent-4-en-1-yne derivatives, namely rooperol, dehydroxyrooperol I and II, bis-dehydroxyrooperol, and hypoxoside, to investigate and compare their antioxidant radical scavenging properties. The main objectives were to model, for the first time, the antioxidant properties of dehydroxyrooperol I and II and bis-dehydroxyrooperol, to clarify the possible role of hypoxoside as radical scavenger and to provide insight into molecular geometry factors influencing the radical scavenging properties of phenolic pent-4-en-1-yne derivatives. The study was conducted by checking the molecules' ability for two main antiradical mechanisms, hydrogen atom transfer and electron transfer. The results indicated that the antiradical properties of rooperol and the two dehydroxyrooperols are predominantly exerted through the hydrogen atom transfer mechanism and are the outcome of the stabilization of their neutral radical species through the interplay of hydrogen bond(s) and spin density distributions stabilizing their neutral radical species. The antiradical properties of bis-dehydroxyrooperol may be explained only in terms of the spin density distribution of its neutral radical species. The antiradical properties of hypoxoside, with O-H bond dissociation enthalpy considerably greater than that of phenol, could be considered to be minor and mainly governed by electron transfer mechanism.

AB Culled plantain pulp starch, peel starch, and peel flour were characterized for their value-addition. Scanning electron microscopy articulated the smooth irregular with elongated and spheroid shaped granules of both culled plantain pulp and peel starch. Culled plantain pulp starch has the highest purity and contained ash (0.1 g/100 g), fat (0.02 g/100 g), protein (0.9 g/100 g), and crude fibre (0.1 g/100 g) with 98 g/100 g whiteness (L* value). The culled plantain contains 40 g/100 g amylose and 77 g/100 g resistant starch. Similar type of viscosity values were found in culled plantain pulp and peel starch with same pasting temperature (84.9 degrees C) measured by Rapid Visco Analyzer. But, very low viscosity values were obtained in peel flour. Highest amount of swelling was 17.4 g/g in culled plantain pulp starch whereas highest amount of solubility (14.6 g/100 g) was recorded in peel flour at 90 degrees C among three samples. Maximum water holding capacity (14.6 g/g) was found in culled plantain pulp starch, followed by 13.5 g/g in peel starch and 8.8 g/g in peel flour at 90 degrees C. The high value of exudates from starch samples indicated unsuitability to use in frozen foods.

AB A new process, Intensification of Vaporization by Decompression to the Vacuum (IVDV), is proposed for texturizing purple maize. It consists in exposing humid kernels to high steam pressure followed by a decompression to the vacuum. Response surface methodology with three operating parameters (initial water content (W), steam pressure (P) and processing time (T)) was used to study the response parameters: Total Anthocyanins Content, Total Polyphenols Content, Free Radical Scavenging Activity, Expansion Ratio, Hardness and Work Done. P was the most important variable, followed by T. Pressure drop helped the release of bound phenolics arriving to their expulsion outside the cell. Combined with convenient T and W, it caused kernels expansion. Multiple optimization of expansion and chemical content showed that IVDV resulted in good texturization of maize while preserving the antioxidant compounds and activity. Optimal conditions were: W = 29%, P = 5 bar and T = 37s. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study reports the optimised conditions (temperature, ethanol concentration and processing-time) for antioxidant extraction from potato peel (Agria variety) waste. At short extraction times (34 min), optimal yields of phenolic (TP) and flavonoid (Fv) compounds were reached at 89.9 degrees C and ethanol concentrations of 71.2% and 38.6%, respectively. The main phenolic compounds identified in the extracts were chlorogenic (Cl) and ferulic (Fer) acids. A significant positive correlation was found between antioxidant activity and TP, Fv, Fer and Cl responses. Potato peel extracts were able to stabilize soybean oil under accelerated oxidation conditions, minimising peroxide, totox and p-anisidine indices. The production of hexanal and 2-hexenal in soybean oil samples was maximal for extracts obtained at intermediate temperatures and ethanol concentrations. Our results demonstrate potato peel waste is a good source of antioxidants able to effectively limit oil oxidation, while contributing to the revalorisation of these agrifood by-products.

AB The objective of this study was to determine whether light backscatter response from fresh pork meat emulsions is correlated to final product stability indices, such as textural parameters, susceptibility of the emulsion to phase separation during cooking and lipid oxidation during subsequent storage. A specially designed fiber optic measurement system was used in combination with a miniature fiber optic spectrometer to determine the intensity of light backscatter within the wavelength range 300-1100 nm at different radial distances (2, 2.5 and 3 mm) with respect to the light source in pork meat emulsions with two fat levels (15%, 30%) and two levels (0%, 2.5%) of the natural antioxidant hydrolyzed potato protein (HPP). Textural parameters (hardness, deformability, cohesiveness and breaking force), cooking loss, TBARS (1, 2, 3, and 7 days) and CIELAB color coordinates of emulsions were measured. The results showed that light backscatter response measured during meat emulsification has potential as an early predictor of emulsion stability during finely comminuted meat products manufacturing.

AB Biofortification, or breeding food crops for improved nutritional content, is a cost effective way to improve nutritional status. The process can, however, alter the sensory characteristics of the crop, and consumer acceptance is essential for their adoption. The oldest biofortified crop is quality protein maize (QPM), biofortified with essential amino acids, a trait now incorporated in many recently-released varieties in East Africa. To estimate rural consumers' acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for QPM in the dispersed population of Northern Tanzania, a novel method, combining a modified home-use test with a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak experiment, was developed. The results showed that rural consumers in Tanzania could distinguish stiff porridge made from QPM and from conventional maize (CM). They generally preferred the former, as expressed by higher scores during affective tests for texture, taste, and overall qualities. Further, rural consumers who were not provided with information about the nutritional benefits of QPM were willing to pay a premium of 16% over CM, and those who were given information, 39%. The scores on the affective test and the information on QPM's nutritional benefits were the main factors determining WTP in the experiment, while no personal characteristics of the participants were found to be significant. We conclude that QPM is, at least, as well accepted as conventional maize, and preferred for its sensory characteristics. Information on nutritional benefits increases rural consumers' willingness to pay for it, so information campaigns may be effective in increasing demand for QPM varieties. However, these varieties need to be competitive for other characteristics that rural households value, in particular, field and storage qualities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB These two studies investigated eating behaviour and food liking of independently living Dutch older people with and without olfactory impairment. In the first study, an internet survey was conducted in relation to their olfactory status (n = 512; age 55-91). Hyposmic older people reported eating the same meal more often within a week than their unimpaired peers, and they also differed in some of the types of foods they reported eating as snacks (i.e. fewer cookies and nuts, more candy). In the second study, various strategies to increase food liking among older consumers were investigated, as well as their liking of reformulated foods with an expected reduced palatability. The strategies included (1) combined visual enrichment and flavour enrichment of mashed potatoes, (2) enhancement of taste intensity and thickness of gravy, and (3) flavour enrichment of stews. The reformulation encompassed (1) salt reduction of meatballs and (2) protein enrichment of bread. Thirty-eight young consumers (age 32.3 +/- 8.9 y), 41 normosmic older consumers (age 65.1 +/- 5.2 y), and 43 hyposmic older consumers (age 68.5 +/- 5.9 y) assessed food liking on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Both older groups increased their food liking in response to the changes made in the mashed potatoes and gravies, decreased their food liking in response to the salt reduction in the meatball and increased their product liking once information was given on the reduction. In conclusion, older persons - regardless of their olfactory status - may respond positively to multi-sensory enrichment in warm meal components. At the same time, certain types of foods may still appeal more or less to hyposmic older persons which in turn may lead to the development of different dietary intake patterns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the microstructural features of different fibres and their effect on gluten-free dough rheology and bread-making. Insoluble fibres (oat and bamboo, fine and coarse, potato and pea), and soluble fibres (Nutriose (R) and polydextrose) were studied. Soluble fibres decreased dough consistency, favoured volume increase during fermentation and produced breads with higher specific volumes, lower hardness, lower luminosity and greater cell density than control breads. The fine insoluble fibres also produced breads with higher specific volumes and lower hardness than controls; however, coarser insoluble fibres gave rise to breads with lower specific volumes and greater hardness than controls. Soluble fibres were found to combine with the hydrocolloid in the aqueous phase, favouring the creation of a film that coated the starch granules and flour particles, giving more stability to the structure, whereas insoluble fibres remained whole, disrupting the structure created.

AB The stability of anthocyanin and phenolic compounds, the antioxidant capacity, the antimicrobial activity and the capacity to inhibit arginase from Leishmania were evaluated in spray-dried powders from Bordo grape winemaking pomace extract. The pigments were produced using maltodextrin as the carrier agent at concentrations varying from 10% to 30% and air entrance temperatures varying from 130 to 170 degrees C. A sample of freeze-dried extract without the carrier was also evaluated. The anthocyanins in the spray-dried samples showed good stability during storage, better than the freeze-dried and liquid extracts. The samples were capable of inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes and showed high inhibitory capacity against the enzyme arginase from Leishmania. These results provide evidence that Bordo grapes from the winemaking process have the potential to be used as natural pigments with functional properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antioxidant components, including anthocyanins and phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity, and their changes during traditional cooking of fresh purple waxy corn were investigated. As compared to the raw corn, thermal treatment caused significant (p <= 0.05) decreases in each antioxidant compound and antioxidant activity. Steam cooking preserved more antioxidant compounds than boiling. Boiling caused a significant loss of anthocyanin and phenolic compounds into the cooking water. This cooking water is a valuable co-product because it is a good source of purple pigment. By comparing levels of antioxidant compounds in raw and cooked corn, we determined that degradation results in greater loss than leaching or diffusion into cooking water. Additionally, separation of kernels from the cob prior to cooking caused increased loss of antioxidant compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of konjac glucomannan (KGM) on the gelatinization, retrogradation and complexation properties of potato and broad bean starches were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and X ray diffraction. It was established that the addition of 1% KGM in starch suspensions causes a slight decrease in the amount of available water in the system. However, this seems sufficient to disrupt the gelatinization and the retrogradation of potato and broad bean starches. In addition, the ability of amylose to interact with carvacrol is strongly affected by the presence of KGM. A rheology study showed on one hand that addition of KGM to starch decreased the gel character of the system, irrespective of the presence of carvacrol. However, carvacrol induced a strong increase of the storage modulus of starch gel for the same KGM content. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The overall research objective was to compare the effects of increasing concentrations of candelilla wax (CnW) on the physicochemical and morphological properties of edible films based on different biopolymers: carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), oxidized potato starch (OPS), soy protein isolate (SPI), and gelatin (GEL). The findings are discussed in terms of the stability of emulsion formulations. CnW was incorporated into film-forming solutions at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0%; sorbitol and Tween 40 were used as the plasticizer and surfactant, respectively. It was found that, with the exception of GEL films, wax incorporation significantly decreased the WVP of the films (from 11.1 to 41.7% compared to the controls). Regardless of the wax concentration used, OPS films had the lowest WVP compared to other films. GEL-based films, in turn, were characterized by the highest mechanical resistance and elongation. The incorporation of CnW decreased both all the analyzed tensile parameters and the puncture strength of the films. Generally, as CnW concentration increased, the transparency and redness of the films decreased, while UV blocking ability and yellowness increased. The 0.5% CnW addition was the most effective in improving water barrier properties, and simultaneously had the lowest impact on the other physical properties of films. For OPS, SPI, and GEL films, sorbitol reclystallization was observed over time. Wax accelerated the sorbitol crystal growth process. CMC films, in contrast to those obtained using other polymers, were completely water soluble and did not exhibit sorbitol crystallization. The emulsion films differed from the wax-free in their surface characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In many food applications, chemically modified starches outperform their native starch counterparts. Starch blends are interesting clean label alternatives with potential for the food industry. Here, potato starch was blended with regular rice, waxy rice, regular maize or waxy maize starch in different ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100). To elucidate the factors determining pasting, different total starch concentrations were used and swelling power and carbohydrate leaching were determined. During pasting, the starches in the blends impacted each other. Peak viscosities of the blends were lower than expected, especially at lower total starch concentrations (<6.0%) due to reduced swelling in the blend. At higher starch concentrations (>6.0%), the relation between peak viscosity and the percentage of a given starch in a blend was rather linear. Under such conditions, viscosity development is determined by granule rigidity rather than by swelling power. Minimum and end viscosities of the blends were intermediate between those of the individual starches at lower total starch concentrations. In contrast, at higher concentrations, minimum and end viscosities were as high as or even higher than the readings for potato starch, especially for blends of potato starch with rice or maize starch. Probably, reduced swelling led to a more conserved granular integrity during cooling which, along with interactions between leached molecules, can contribute to viscosity development. These results indicate that pasting of starch blends does not only depend on the individual starches and the blend composition, but also on the total starch concentration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sweet potato amylose and amylopectin were isolated from retrograded sweet potato starch. During isolation, the retrograded starches were resolved in 4.0 M KOH and then 4.0 M HCl was added to adjust the pH of the solutions to neutral, therefore KCl was formed in starch solutions. Long or short crystals of KCl grew on sweet potato amylose solution or amylopectin solution in the drying process. The results of IR, NMR, XRD, DSC and SEM of corresponding samples suggest that the attraction of amylose or amylopectin to KCl leads to the formation of snowflake crystals. The shape of KCl crystals growing in starch solutions acts more like biological macromolecular crystals than that of inorganic salt. Amylose promotes the growth of KCl crystals, while amylopectin inhibits it. The different up and down field of C-6 signals in NMR indicates the different link pattern of starch with KCl salt. In the course of crystallization, sweet potato starch grows into B-type crystal, with the characteristic strongest peak located at 17 degrees. KCl is entrapped by starch in the crystallization progress during starch drying. The findings in the paper provide an insight into the interaction between starch and salts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Satiety expectations can be closely related to the structural changes that take place in the mouth. An important role of hydrocolloids is to impart viscosity, which has a key effect on the feelings of richness, mouthcoating and fullness. In this study, native and modified corn starch, X-carrageenan and guar gum were used to formulate milkshakes. Expected satiety was rated (106 consumers) and the perception of various attributes was studied. The rheological properties of the milkshakes without and with added saliva were analysed and observed with a light microscope during in vitro oral digestion.
   Disintegration of the swollen starch granules by saliva was observed mainly in the modified starch sample. The structure of the milkshakes prepared with A-carrageenan and guar gum was preserved better. It could be hypothesized that the starch would provide lower expected satiety due to the extensive in-mouth disintegration. However, the sensory analysis showed that the modified starch milkshakes obtained the highest expected satiety scores, with consumers finding them homogeneous, thick in the mouth and very creamy. These results suggested that consumers related satiety more with the thick and creamy characteristics at the very start of the consumption than with the loss of structure in mouth. Sensory properties affect the assessment of the satiating capacity, especially texture, which is directly related to the orosensory exposure and, therefore, to the feeling of fullness that the milkshakes elicit. The present study casts light on the factors affecting in-mouth perception of different hydrocolloids used to design foods with enhanced satiety. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Steryl glycosides (SG) contribute significantly to the total intake of phytosterols. The standard analytical procedure involving acid hydrolysis fails to reflect the correct sterol profile of SG due to isomerization of some of the labile sterols. Therefore, various glycosylases were evaluated for their ability to hydrolyse SG under milder conditions. Using a pure SG mixture in aqueous solution, the highest glycolytic activity, as demonstrated by the decrease in SG and increase in free sterols was achieved using inulinase preparations (decrease of >95%). High glycolytic activity was also demonstrated using hemicellulase (63%). The applicability of enzymatic hydrolysis using inulinase preparations was further verified on SG extracted from foods. For example in potato peel Delta(5)-avenasteryl glucoside, a labile SG, was well preserved and contributed 26.9% of the total SG. Therefore, enzymatic hydrolysis is suitable for replacing acid hydrolysis of SG in food lipid extracts to accurately determine the sterol profile of SG. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of repeated retrogradation (RR) treatment on the structural characteristics and in vitro digestibility of waxy potato starch were investigated. The cycling times of RR ranging from 1 to 5 were designated as RR-1, RR-2, RR-3, RR-4, and RR-5, respectively. A maximum SDS content (40.41%) was obtained by RR-2 treatment with the time interval of 48 h. RR-2-treated starch product exhibited a narrower melting temperature range, a higher onset temperature and a lower melting enthalpy compared with RR-1 treatment. Compared with native starch, X-ray diffraction patterns of treated starches were altered from B-type to C-type. The variation in relative crystallinity of RR-treated starch products was consistent with that in melting enthalpy. Moreover, compared with RR-1-treated starch, a large number of cavities were observed on the surface of RR-2-treated starch product with a time interval of 48 h, whereas more smooth regions were found on the surface of RR-5-treated starch product. This study suggested that structural changes of waxy potato starch treated with different cycling times of RR significantly affected the digestibility. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated hydration of acid hydrolyzed potato starch (maltodextrin) employing a multi-method approach. In particular, synchrotron radiation X-ray scattering and differential scanning calorimetry were used, and, for the first time, the material was investigated with sorption calorimetry and a newly developed quartz crystal microbalance with humidity scanning. The dry starch was found to be in an amorphous state. During hydration it exhibits a glass transition in both bulk and thin film samples, followed by an exothermic event where the starch crystallized. Recrystallized bulk samples displayed neither a pronounced glass transition nor crystallization upon hydration whereas both events occurred in thin film samples. The hydration-driven crystallization resulted in an X-ray pattern consistent with the coexistence of A and B type crystallites; however, at higher water concentrations only the B form occurred. The results were used to construct the first ever acid hydrolyzed starch water phase diagram. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The in vitro digestibility, molecular structure and crystalline structure of waxy rice starches isolated from six Korean cultivars (Shinsun, Dongjin, Baekok, Whasun, Chungbaek, and Bosuk) were investigated. The molecular weight (M-w) of waxy rice starches ranged from 1.1 x 10(8) g/mol to 2.2 x 10(8) g/mol. Chungbaek waxy rice starch had the highest average chain length (24.3) and proportion (20.7%) of long branch chains (DP >= 37), and the lowest proportion (19.0%) of short branch chains (DP 6-12) among the tested six waxy rice starches. The relative crystallinity and intensity ratio of 1047/1022 ranged from 38.9% to 41.1% and from 0.691 to 0.707, respectively. Chungbaek had the highest gelatinization temperature and enthalpy. Chungbaek had the highest pasting temperature (70.7 degrees C), setback (324 cP) and final viscosity (943 cP), whereas Baekok showed the highest peak viscosity (1576 cP) and breakdown (1031 cP). Chungbaek had lower rapidly digestible starch (RDS) content and expected glycemic index (eGI), and higher resistant starch (RS) content, whereas Whasun exhibited higher RDS content and eGI. The slowly digestible starch (SDS) content of Shinsun (38.3%) and Bokok (32.0%) was significantly higher than that of other cultivars (11.3-22.0%). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A simple and fast analytical method for the determination of the main steroidal glycoalkaloids, alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine, in commercial potato crisps, based on QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, Safe) extraction and ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrospray ionization triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS) in the multiple reaction monitoring mode was established and validated. The sample preparation procedure involves the extraction of the analytes with acidified acetonitrile and simultaneous liquid-liquid partitioning achieved by an addition of anhydrous magnesium sulfate and sodium acetate without any further clean-up steps. The limits of quantification (LOQs) for alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine were 31 mu g kg(-1) and 16 mu g kg(-1) of fresh mass, respectively, at the signal-to-noise ratio (S/Ns) of 10. The method was applied in a survey of the content of alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine in twenty commercial potato crisps from different brands. The results showed that all the products contained alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine in widely varying concentrations. The amount of alpha-chaconine was higher than that of alpha-solanine in all samples.

AB This study presents a simultaneous application of pressure cooking and microwave irradiation to consolidate ceramic slurry as a rapid shaping technique. The ceramic slurry, composed of red clay, feldspar, quartz and water, was solidified with the gelatinization of starch under varying heating conditions inside a domestic microwave pressure cooker. It was found out that, for a small amount of ceramic slurry, a shortest heating time of 2.52 min was achieved at microwave pressure cooking conditions of 50% power level and target temperature of 60 degrees C. Based on these conditions, large shaped ceramic prototypes of different shapes were successfully formed using proposed empirical equations to determine a desired heating time at any power levels. The physical characterizations revealed that the physical properties of dried and fired ceramic bodies formed under microwave pressure cooking were better than that of the conventional counterpart. Microstructural investigation into the fired samples revealed larger void spaces in conventional sample than that in microwave pressure-cooked sample. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

AB A commercial electronic nose (e-nose) equipped with a metal oxide sensor array was trained to recognize volatile compounds emitted by potatoes experimentally infected with Ralstonia solanacearutn or Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus, which are bacterial agents of potato brown and ring rot, respectively. Two sampling procedures for volatile compounds were tested on pooled tubers sealed in 0.5-1 L jars at room temperature (laboratory conditions): an enrichment unit containing different adsorbent materials (namely, Tenax (R) TA, Carbotrap, Tenax (R) GR, and Carboxen 569) directly coupled with the e-nose (active sampling) and a Radielle (TM) cartridge (passive sampling) containing a generic Carbograph fiber. Tenax (R) TA resulted the most suitable adsorbent material for active sampling. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) correctly classified 57.4 and 81.3% total samples as healthy or diseased, when using active and passive sampling, respectively. These results suggested the use of passive sampling to discriminate healthy from diseased tubers under intermediate and real scale conditions. 80 and 90% total samples were correctly classified by LDA under intermediate (100 tubers stored at 4 degrees C in net bag passively sampled) and real scale conditions (tubers stored at 4 degrees C in 1.25 t bags passively sampled). Principal component analysis (PCA) of sensorial analysis data under laboratory conditions highlighted a strict relationship between the disease severity and the responses of the e-nose sensors, whose sensitivity threshold was linked to the presence of at least one tuber per sample showing medium disease symptoms. At intermediate and real scale conditions, data distribution agreed with disease incidence (percentage of diseased tubers), owing to the low storage temperature and volatile compounds unconfinement conditions adopted.

AB Single bounce attenuated total reflectance (SB-ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in conjunction with chemometrics was used for accurate determination of free fatty acid (FFA), peroxide value (PV), iodine value (IV), conjugated diene (CD) and conjugated triene (CT) of cottonseed oil (CSO) during potato chips frying. Partial least square (PLS), stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), principal component regression (PCR) and simple Beer's law (SBL) were applied to develop the calibrations for simultaneous evaluation of five stated parameters of cottonseed oil (CSO) during frying of French frozen potato chips at 170 degrees C. Good regression coefficients (R-2) were achieved for FFA, PV, IV, CD and CT with value of > 0.992 by PLS, SMLR, PCR, and SBL. Root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was found to be less than 1.95% for all determinations. Result of the study indicated that SB-ATR FTIR in combination with multivariate chemometrics could be used for accurate and simultaneous determination of different parameters during the frying process without using any toxic organic solvent.

AB Although the role of industrial policy in economic development is a frequent topic of debate in both the literature and the political arena, most discussions focus on industrial policymaking at the national level. Using a case study of a potato cluster in China, we show that industrial policymaking at the local level contributes greatly to economic development as well. Many of the industrial policies affecting the cluster-including leveling land, developing better varieties, establishing a potato trade association, lobbying for increasing freight car quotas, and attracting processing firms-were implemented at the local level, highlighting the need for discussion of local industrial policymaking as a major determinant of cluster development. As the case study demonstrates, economic development is a continuous process with constantly evolving binding supply-side and demand-side constraints. Often, after a local policy helps remove one binding constraint, a new one emerges that, in turn, may require a new set of policies. Therefore, the success of clusters depends upon local industrial policies that respond to emerging binding constraints at different stages of the cluster's development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Confectionery fillings are products used in confectionery and baking industry containing approximately 30-40 g fat/100 g product. Due to the high fat content, they have considerable high caloric value. Therefore, there is a trend to decrease fat content in confectionery filling formulations. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using two types of maltodextrin gels as potential fat replacers in confectionery fillings.
   Vegetable fat was partially replaced by potato maltodextrin and specially derived waxy-maize maltodextrin aqueous gels (15 and 20 g/100 g) in three different ratios (5, 10 and 15 g/100 g). The increase in the amount of fat reduction resulted in an increase in hardness and change in colour of the final product. According to sensory analysis performed by trained sensory panel as well as by measurements of product acceptance-preference performed by untrained panellists (consumers), confectionery filling with 5 g/100 g fat reduction had the highest scores. However, according to product acceptance preference test, it was estimated that the final product with 15 g/100 g fat reduction was also sensory acceptable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effect of vacuum time, restoration time, steam-cooking and storage at 4 C on the iron content of vacuum-impregnated (VI) whole potato was evaluated. Whole potato tubers were immersed in a 0.4 g/100 g iron (ferric pyrophosphate) solution. Vacuum pressure of 1000 Pa was applied for 0-120 min, and atmospheric pressure restoration for 0-4 h. The result indicated that the iron content of VI potatoes increased with vacuum and restoration time; 1 h vacuum-treatment potatoes provided 6.4 times higher iron content compared to raw potatoes, and 3 h restoration time supplied 6.4 times higher iron content (>4.1 mg/100 g fr.wt.) compared to raw potatoes. Moreover, VI-cooked unpeeled or peeled potatoes had 6 times higher iron content than un-VI-cooked unpeeled or peeled potatoes. European daily potato consumption (260 g) of the VI-cooked unpeeled and peeled potatoes provided adult men with 93-104% and 67-90% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of iron, respectively. Also, the daily potato consumption of the unpeeled and peeled potatoes could supply adult women with 43-48% and 31-41% of the RDA, respectively. This study indicated that VI treatment of whole potato was useful for enriching the iron content. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anthocyanins are intriguing natural pigments with beneficial bioactivities and their colour is extremely susceptible to acidity variation. Minimisation of colour fluctuation is essential to maintain quality consistency in food industry. A new strategy employing surfactants to mimic encapsulation was attempted with typical anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants and proved effective although the traditional copigmentation method was inactive. The exceptional colour fluctuation buffering effect of anionic surfactants especially sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) was revealed and then carefully analysed by colonmetric and spectroscopic methods. The outstanding activity of SDS presumably resulted from effective shielding of anthocyanins from external acidity through strong interaction with the positively charged flavylium cations owing to its anionic nature. These results suggest SDS is a valuable additive for buffering colour fluctuation of anthocyanins. The strategy of surfactant will be useful for buffering colour fluctuation of natural colourants.

AB In this article, a drip-fertigation system was compared to a control without irrigation concerning the amount of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions under the climatic conditions of north-east Germany. The investigation was carried out at a field research station in the federal state of Brandenburg. The mean N2O emissions under drip-fertigation were significantly higher than under non-irrigation. The higher N2O emissions under drip-fertigation can be explained by a constantly higher water-filled pore space (WFPS). These higher values in WFPS were caused by the necessary nutrient supply in combination with additional water application in periods with frequent rainfall.

AB Water footprinting (WF) is mooted to quantify the impacts of production on water resources. The impact of the rain-fed potato (Solanum tuberosum) production on water resources was assessed for a kilogram of potatoes at the packhouse gate. The hydrological water-balance method was used and this accounts for all inflows and outflows to quantify the net use of groundwater as the blue WF, and that of the soil-water store as the green WF. The green WF was found to be negligible. The blue WF was negative at -67 L/kg. Thus rain-fed potato production here has no deleterious impacts on the water quantity.
   The grey WF, the water required to 'dilute' NO3-N in the drainage to meet the drinking water standard, was 61 L/kg, of which 56 L/kg was from the cropping stage. The impact of the packhouse phase and the background system was found to be small. However, the average leached NO3-N concentration of 113 mg/L, which is just at the drinking water standard, and the loading of 27.8 kg-N/ha/y during cultivation indicate that a single application of fertilizer at the time of planting has impacts on water quality. Our modelling of different fertilizer application scenarios of two splits, three splits and a late application at 55 days after planting reduced the annual average NO3-N concentrations to 10.5, 10.3 and 9.5 mg/L respectively. Potato yield was not compromised. The grey WE would be reduced to 50.6, 50.9 and 48.9 L/kg respectively for these fertilizer scenarios. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agriculture imposes demands on freshwater resources. Water footprinting has been proposed to quantify those impacts. To date, water footprints have been assessed only through modelling. We quantified the water footprint (WF) using measured soil water content and drainage under potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) grown in the Manawatu region of New Zealand. The net uses of groundwater and soil-water storage were considered to be the blue and green WFs, respectively. The drainage below the root zone was measured using tension fluxmeters over a cropping season and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations were analysed. The mean of the cumulative drainage was 263.8 mm (SE +/- 84). Irrigation was not used, so the blue-WF was equal to the drainage. It was negative at -58.6 L/kg indicating that potato cultivation contributes to groundwater recharge. The green-WF was 15.8 L/kg. However, this green-water deficit would certainly be replenished, by winter rainfall. The grey-WF, the water needed to 'dilute' the leachate to the drinking water standard, was 133.1 L/kg of potato. The water quality impact based on the used-fraction of the nitrate assimilation capacity of groundwater was just 4.82 x 10(-11) for a kg of potato. The NO3-N leaching pattern reveals that some of the losses could be minimized through changed fertilizer practices. We estimated that 20 fluxmeters, rather than the six we used, would be needed to reduce the SE to 12.5% of the mean. Therefore, modelling will be the cost-effective means of quantifying the WFs. Nonetheless, model validation will always be necessary. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using native cassava starch as raw materials, carboxymethyl starch (CMS) was prepared by ethanol solvent method under the ultrasound-microwave synergistic interaction. And the structure of CMS was characterized employing Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analyzer. Typically, the optimal synthesis conditions for the preparation process confirmed by orthogonal experiment L-18 (6(1) X 3(6)) were shown as follows: the ultrasonic treatment temperature was fixed to 35 degrees C and two steps alkalization was employed; the ultrasonic time was 40 min before alkalizing and the ultrasonic power was 220 W; the amount of sodium hydroxide was 8.8 g, the microwave alkalization time was 2 min; the amount of monochloroacetic acid was 11.34 g; the amount of 95% (v/v) ethanol was 70 mL; the microwave etherification time was 3 min. The degree of substitution of prepared CMS was 1.089 +/- 0.041, which was increased 30.4% compared with the prepared sample without ultrasound-microwave synergistic treatment. FTIR results showed that the strong -COO- characteristic absorption peaks of the stretching vibration were observed at 1613 and 1421 cm(-1), which proved that the carboxymethylation of cassava starch was occurred. SEM results suggested that there were many cracks and dents on CMS granules; and, XRD results indicated that the carboxymethylation of starch occurred both in amorphous region and crystalline region, the noticeable damage of crystalline region by carboxymethylation was observed. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and derivative TG showed that thermal stability of CMS changed better compared with native starch. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB More than 10 red anthocyanins and related glucosides have been isolated and identified from purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas, Ayamurasaki) in the recent decades. This paper reports the isolation of colourless caffeoyl compounds from purple sweet potato using AB-8 macroresin absorption and semi-preparative HPLC-DAD. The structures of the five isolated monomers were identified as: 5-caffeoylquinic acid (1), 6-O-caffeoyl-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2-1)-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (2) and trans-4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3), 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (4), 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (5), and by ESI/MS and NMR. Compounds 1, 4 and 5 were reported previously in combination with anthocyanins in purple sweet potato, whereas 2 and 3 were found for the first time. In vitro antioxidant assay showed trans-4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid has significant antioxidant activities. These results should lay the groundwork for further work identifying purple sweet potato as a healthy food. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the research was to examine the effect of the laboratory production of dried potato dice on the content of phenolic compounds in one yellow-fleshed potato variety and four blue-fleshed potatoes varieties. Coloured-flesh potato varieties were characterised by about three times higher amount of total phenolic content than traditional yellow-fleshed ones. The predominating phenolic acids in potato were chlorogenic acid and its isomers, which account about 90% of total phenolic content in tubers. The phenolic acid content decreased by 80% after peeling the blue-fleshed potatoes and by 60% after peeling the yellow variety. The dried potato dice obtained from yellow-fleshed potatoes had no content of phenolic acids but produced from colour-fleshed potatoes contained about 4% of the original phenolic content of the raw material. Chlorogenic acid amounted about 97% of total phenolic acid content, and the rest was neochlorogenic acid. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, we introduce a simple method to prepare inclusion complexes by "inserting" guest molecules into preformed "empty" V-type amylose helices. Ascorbyl palmitate (AscP) was used as a model guest material to investigate the effect of solvent environment, complexation temperature, annealing and guest concentration on inclusion complex formation. High complexation temperature was not necessary for encapsulating guest molecules in amylose helices, avoiding thermal degradation of guest compounds. This method would also avoid the wasting of guest materials because uncomplexed guest can be reused. It was found in the study that intermediate ethanol and acetone concentrations (generally 40-60%, v/v) at room temperature were appropriate for the complexation between V-amylose and AscP. Annealing, i.e. heat treatment in ethanol solutions at elevated temperatures (45-70 degrees C), was able to significantly increase the crystallinity of V-amylose and V-starch to as high as 65% and facilitate greater complexation evidenced from higher enthalpies, probably due to more regularly arranged helical cavities in larger crystalline phase. The complexation between V-amylose and AscP was also found to be enhanced with AscP concentration, while the dissociation temperature experienced a slight decrease. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A series of carboxymethyl agars (CMAs) with different degree of substitution (DS) were prepared, and their properties were determined and analyzed. The results showed that with the increase of DS, the dissolving temperature, the gelling temperature, the gel melting temperature, the gel strength, the gel hardness, the gel fracturability, and the solution apparent viscosity of CMA all decreased, except that its gel cohesiveness and gel springiness increased. The variation process of agar molecules in solution from coil to helix could be observed by measuring the optical rotation of the solution at such a low concentration, at which even the solution could not form a gel. The gel skeleton microstructures of both agar and CMA were of porous network structure, and the pore size of CMA became smaller and denser with the increase of its DS. After carboxymethylation, the agar hygroscopicity was improved, but its thermal stability was lowered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of the amylose:amylopectin ratio on the properties of pea, potato and cassava starch films and the effect of the incorporation of rice bran of two different particle sizes were studied. The structural, mechanical, optical and barrier properties of the films were analyzed after 1 and 5 weeks. The high content of amylose gave rise to stiffer, more resistant to fracture, but less stretchable films, with lower oxygen permeability and greater water binding capacity. Although no changes in the water vapour permeability values of the films were observed during storage, their oxygen permeability decreased. Throughout storage, films became stiffer, more resistant to break, but less stretchable. Rice bran with the smallest particles improved the elastic modulus of the films, especially in high amylose content films, but reduced the film stretchability and its barrier properties, due to the enhancement of the water binding capacity and the introduction of discontinuities.

AB The effects of pregelatinized potato starch concentration (PSC) ranged from 0 to 5 wt% on the physical stability, color, rheological, textural, and sensory properties of model salad dressings prepared with 2 wt% dried egg yolk (DEY) or sodium caseinate (SC) were explored. All dressings showed shear-thinning behavior with yield stress. Raising PSC increased storage (G') and loss (G '') moduli decreasing loss tangent (tan delta) and samples containing >= 3 wt% starch showed a weak gel-like (tan delta <1) response. A generalized Cox-Merz rule was applicable to indicate shear/strain sensitivity of the dressings structures. Rheological characterization based on Bohlin's parameters (A, z) was useful for distinguishing physical stability of dressings made with different formulations. Changes in color were generally very small and mainly PSC-dependent. Correlation analyses revealed that sensory descriptors could be satisfactory modeled with the appropriate instrumental data. Overall, the results proved that pregelatinized potato starch may be suitable ingredient in low-fat dressings applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An insoluble biocomposite composed of potato starch and chitosan was prepared by microwave treatment. The effect of pH on swelling (liquid absorption) behavior of the composites was investigated at pH 2, pH 6.8 and pH 12. Analysis revealed that the solution uptake ratio of composites depends both on the aqueous pH value and the content of the chitosan. Composites exhibited a relatively high swelling ratio at pH environments lower than the pK(a) of amine groups on chitosan (about 6.3). Glucose analysis by ion exchange chromatography showed that there was little hydrolysis of such composites at low pH. When immersed in the same pH solution, composites with higher chitosan content exhibited higher swelling ratios. The microstructure of composites produced was also investigated by FE-SEM.

AB An experimental facility was built at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in order to examine the characteristics of convective drying of a moist object. The test facility consists of an inlet section, a divergent and convergent section, a settling chamber, a test section, and an outlet section. Initial moisture content and time-dependent moisture content of a rectangular shaped moist object (4cm x 2cm x 2cm) are measured by this test facility. The potato slice was selected as a sample moist object. Moisture content was measured at different air temperatures of 40, 50, 60, and 70 degrees C with an air velocity of 2m/sec. The density of potato slice was determined for various drying temperatures. The volume shrinkage during drying decreased almost linearly with moisture content. The percentage air pores and porosity increased gradually with decreasing moisture content and increasing drying air temperature. Volumes of water, air, and solid content of potato were determined at different drying air temperatures. The results are validated with theoretical data.

AB The tea aphid, Toxoptera aurantii, also called the "black citrus aphid", is one of the most destructive insect pests in commercial tea plantations and gardens in southern China. In autumn, declining day length triggers production of winged T. aurantii sexuparae, which produce both winged males and wingless oviparae. Oviparous females then release sex pheromone that attracts potential mates. GC-MS analysis of volatile headspace extracts of T. aurantii oviparae revealed that they emit (4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactone (I) and (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactol (II) in a ratio of 4.3-4.9:1. Field-trapping experiments with synthetic I and II singly or as two-component blends of different doses and ratios showed significant attraction of T. aurantii males, as well as weak attraction of sexuparae. Identification of the T. aurantii sex pheromone provides a new opportunity for developing a pheromone-based monitoring and management strategy for the sexual phase of tea aphids and, possibly, the alate sexparous generation in late summer and fall.

AB Wireworms are the soil inhabiting larvae of click beetles and can cause severe damage to arable crops such as potatoes (Solanum tuberosum, L.). Several strains of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum (Petch) are pathogenic to wireworms. In this study, three European strains of M. brunneum were tested in the laboratory against the most damaging wireworm species in Europe, Agriotes lineatus (L.), Agriotes obscurus (L.) and Agriotes sputator (L.). A Swiss strain, isolated from an A. obscurus cadaver, proved to be most effective, killing up to 73% of A. lineatus and 83% A. obscurus individuals, respectively. The median lethal time (LT50) was 21 days post inoculation (dpi) for A. lineatus and 14 dpi for A. obscurus. The strain did not lose virulence through subsequent cultivation on artificial medium and thus seems to be suitable for mass production as a biocontrol agent for wireworm control.

AB Behavioural and physiological changes during diapause, an important strategy of insects for surviving harsh seasonal conditions, have been intensively studied. The genetic and molecular mechanisms underpinning diapause development are less well known. We took a candidate gene approach to study prediapause gene expression patterns in the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), an invasive insect that has rapidly spread northwards to high seasonality environments. Newly eclosed beetles originating from southern (Italy) and northern (Russia) Europe were reared under short-[12 h light (L): 12 h dark (D)] and long-day (18L:6D) photoperiods for 10 days. This time period includes the sensitive period for the photoperiodic induction and initiation of diapause. Gene expression trajectories of 12 diapause-related genes (regulatory, metabolic and stress-resistance) were analysed from 0-, 5- and 10-day-old beetles. Gene expression differences increased with age, deviating significantly between populations and photoperiods in 10-day-old beetles. The gene expression profiles, particularly those related to energy metabolism and stress-resistance, indicate that beetles originating from Russia also prepare for diapause under the long-day photoperiod and show qualitative differences in the diapausing phenotype. Our study shows that population-dependent differences seen in behavioural and physiological traits connected with diapause in L. decemlineata are also evident in the expression trajectories of diapause-related genes.

AB Ecdysone 20-monooxygenase (E20MO), a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP314A1), catalyses the conversion of ecdysone (E) to 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). We report here the cloning and characterization of the Halloween gene Shade (Shd) encoding E20MO in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata. LdSHD has five conserved motifs typical of insect P450s, ie the Helix-C, Helix-I, Helix-K, PxxFxPE/DRF (PERF) and heme-binding motifs. LdShd was expressed in developing eggs, the first to fourth instars, wandering larvae, pupae and adults, with statistically significant fluctuations. Its mRNA was ubiquitously distributed in the head, thorax and abdomen. The recombinant LdSHD protein expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells catalysed the conversion of E to 20E. Dietary introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of LdShd into the second instar larvae successfully knocked down the LdShd expression level, decreased the mRNA level of the ecdysone receptor (LdEcR) gene, caused larval lethality, delayed development and affected pupation. Moreover, ingestion of LdShd-dsRNA by the fourth instars also down-regulated LdShd and LdEcR expression, reduced the 20E titre, and negatively influenced pupation. Introduction of 20E and a nonsteroidal ecdysteroid agonist halofenozide into the LdShd-dsRNA-ingested second instars, and of halofenozide into the LdShd-dsRNA-ingested fourth instars almost completely relieved the negative effects on larval performance. Thus, LdSHD functions to regulate metamorphotic processes by converting E to 20E in a coleopteran insect species Le. decemlineata.

AB Potato starch processing waste is causing serious environmental problems. This study aimed to convert potato starch processing waste into single-cell protein as high-quality feed using a two-step fermentation process. The mutant strain Aspergillus niger H3 was selected after UV irradiation and ethyl methyl sulfone mutagenesis for more cellulase production. The activities of sodium carboxymethyl cellulase and filter paperase of strain H3 were 8.86 and 4.79 U, respectively, which were much higher than the parent strain (1.18 and 0.62 U). After treatment with strain H3, the cellulose degradation rate of potato residue was 80.54 %. A liquid fermentation using Bacillus licheniformis was performed as the second step. The optimized fermentation conditions were temperature of 32.8 A degrees C, pH 6.67, and inoculum concentration of 1.78 % using the response surface method. Results of this study showed a potential application in large-scale industrial conversion.

AB We prepared an ethanol extract from Laminaria japonica, and obtained five fractions from the extract using various solvents. We investigated the antibacterial activities of the fractions against Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (Spieckermann & Kotthoff) Davis et al., the causal agent of bacterial ring rot of potato (BRR). Among all the fractions, the petroleum ether fraction showed the strongest (P < 0.05) antibacterial activity against C. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus. We analyzed the petroleum ether fraction to detect the components with antibacterial activity, and identified 24 compounds. The main constituents of the petroleum ether extract were esters (35.28 %) and acids (44.84 %). Cell membrane permeability assays, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses revealed that the petroleum ether fraction caused drastic ultrastructural changes in the cells of the pathogen. The petroleum ether fraction caused envelope disruption, cell deformation, the separation of the cell wall from the cell membrane, and the formation of vacuoles. These results clearly indicate that the petroleum ether fraction obtained from L. japonica shows strong antibacterial activity against the causal agent of BRR.

AB Stem rot symptoms caused by pectinolytic bacteria of Genus Pectobacterium and Genus Dickeya, which are commonly referred to as blackleg, strongly impact the quality of seed potato production in most European countries. Several biotic and abiotic factors, such as cultivar susceptibility, isolate aggressiveness, mother tuber infection density and a wide range of soil-related and climatic factors have been identified in the literature as having an effect on blackleg development. The aim of this study was to identify which biotic and/or abiotic factors are most critical to the development of blackleg in the field. In Switzerland, the predominant species have belonged to Genus Dickeya as far back as 1992, which is why this study only investigates blackleg symptoms induced by Dickeya isolates. Seven field trials, in which inoculated tubers were planted, were conducted during a 3-year period and the number of blackleg-diseased plants was counted. Multiple regression analysis was used in order to determine the factors that had the greatest impact on two different variables: (i) periods between emergence of the plant and disease outbreak and (ii) overall blackleg incidence throughout the growing season. The results of this analysis have revealed that environmental factors, such as evapotranspiration and soil moisture, explain about half of the variability in the number of days before disease outbreak, and the total number of diseased plants is widely dependent upon cultivar susceptibility and isolate aggressiveness.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB The biofumigation potential of brassicaceous green manures to Verticillium dahliae was systematically assessed. In a toxicological study, five different isothiocyanates (ITCs) were tested using a bioassay with sterile quartz sand artificially infested with microsclerotia. For 2-propenyl ITC, a LD90 value of 88.7 nmol g(-1) was determined. Furthermore, 2-propenyl ITC with a dose of 150 nmol g(-1) soil was tested in 22 naturally infested soils. The efficiency varied from 9 % to 92 % and was negatively correlated with the organic carbon content of the soils, indicating that in many soils much higher concentrations will be necessary to achieve sufficient control. To evaluate the biofumigation potential of different Brassicaceae, 19 cultivars of Brassica juncea, Rhaphanus sativus and Sinapis alba were grown in the field. Biomass production was measured and glucosinolate concentrations were analyzed. Simulating the field situation, the biofumigation effect of cultivars was assessed in a standardized laboratory bioassay with microsclerotia-infested sterile quartz sand amended with freeze-dried ground plant tissues. Amendments of B. juncea shoot tissue reduced the number of viable microsclerotia significantly with efficiencies from 69.3 to 81.3 %. Total potentially released amounts of 2-propenyl ITC ranged between 50.6-78.1 nmol g(-1)sand and indicate a clear ITC-related suppression. However these are considered too low for effective control in practice as low release efficiencies mean that effective levels fall well short of the estimated 150 nmol g(-1) of soil required. In comparison with B. juncea, the R. sativus and S. alba were less effective due to lower concentrations and/or toxicity of the ITC released. In summary, the biofumigation potential of the cultivars tested appears insufficient alone for effective control, especially on soils with higher (> 1.0 %) organic carbon content.

AB Partition coefficients between plant cuticles and water (K-cutw) were measured for 10 selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to evaluate the sorption capacity of plant cuticular layers for hydrophobic organic chemicals. The partitioning properties of PAHs between cuticles and water were evaluated by using (1) isolated cuticular layers and (2) leaf homogenate. The abaxial and adaxial cuticular layers of Euonymus japonicus were isolated by enzymatic digestion. A third-phase partitioning method using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) was used to obtain K-cutw. The K-cutw values for the selected PAHs showed no significant differences between the abaxial and adaxial cuticular layers and ranged between 10(4.1) and 10(7.6). These values are close to or slightly higher than their 1-octanol/water partition coefficient (log K-ow), indicating high sorption capacity of plant cuticles. On the contrary, partition coefficients between the lipid tissues of homogenized leaves and water were lower than those obtained using isolated cuticular layers by factors of 3.7-190, which is likely due to the breakdown of lipid layers. This indicates that the sorption of hydrophobic organic chemicals by plant leaves is better evaluated using isolated cuticles and that the sorption potential of plant leaves may be underestimated when leaf homogenates are used.

AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an attractive technology in tropical regions for converting locally abundant biomass wastes into biogas which can be used to produce heat, electricity, and transportation fuels. However, investigations on AD of tropical forestry wastes, such as albizia biomass and food wastes, such as taro, papaya, and sweet potato, are limited. In this study, these tropical biomass wastes were evaluated for biogas production by liquid AD (L-AD) and/or solid-state AD (SS-AD), depending on feedstock characteristics. When albizia leaves and chips were used as feedstocks, L-AD had greater methane yields (161 and 113 L kg (1) VS, respectively) than SS-AD (156.8 and 59.6 L kg (1) VS, respectively), while SS-AD achieved 5-fold higher volumetric methane productivity than L-AD. Mono-digestion and co-digestion of taro skin, taro flesh, papaya, and sweet potato achieved methane yields from 345 to 411 L kg (1) VS, indicating the robustness of AD technology.

In this study, the effect of impact stress (dropping treatment) on the expression of genes related to respiratory byproducts and ethylene synthesis of the cabbage was investigated. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that cabbage leaf wounds caused by dropping treatment significantly increased the expression of genes (BoAPX2, BoPAL, BoSAMS, and BoACS2) in the wounded area and the surrounding leaf area within I h after the treatment. Additionally, we proposed a novel mathematical model based on a modified Weibull distribution (MWD) to describe the stress response characteristics of the cabbage. Using a non-linear least square method, the proposed prediction model fitted the respiration rate and relative gene expression experimental data very well. The model parameters are also clearly defined and discussed. The results, therefore, suggest possible uses of the model for predicting the stress-responsive cellular metabolisms and quality changes of postharvest fresh produce. Furthermore, this model has potential to become valuable tool for developing the postharvest techniques to minimize quality loss and to extend the shelf-life of fresh produce. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The joint investigation of the product, the consumer, and the consumption context is necessary for furthering the understanding of eating occasions (snacks and main meals), including their construction and enjoyment. The study of people's experience of eating occasions is less advanced than the understanding of acceptability, preference, and choice of individual food/beverage items and/or their combination in meals. The current research contributes to narrowing this gap by focusing on emotions as a dimension of eating experiences and enjoyment. Under evoked consumption contexts (breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner), the emotion associations for several products (potato crisps, chocolate brownie, and kiwi-fruit) were obtained from consumers (n = 399) using a questionnaire method. Emotion associations were explored in relation to: (1) the way in which the food stimulus was evaluated by participants (tasting food vs. seeing a food image); (2) the serving presentation of the food stimulus (image of food shown in isolation vs. image of food served on a plate with cutlery); and (3) the means in which the consumption context was evoked (written vs. written and pictorial). Consumers' product emotion associations when tasting a food stimulus vs. seeing an image of the same food were highly similar. There was some evidence that more specific means of presenting the food stimuli (with tableware vs. without tableware) and consumption contexts (written and pictorially vs. written only) influenced perceived appropriateness of the product in the focal consumption context. This resulted, for example, in a higher frequency of use of negative emotion terms in the less appropriate consumption contexts. Overall, through the use of evoked consumption contexts this research has contributed new understanding of product-specific emotional associations during eating occasions from a methodological approach. In addition to the aforementioned results a more general finding was the apparent reliance by participants on past product experiences when completing the emotion questionnaire.

AB This paper reports the procedure used for the calibration of a mathematical model of the low-pressure-vaporization in free water previously developed by the authors. This calibration includes the determination of the time to the flash point, the time to the transition between the first and the second boiling regimes, the difference between the liquid-vapor interface pressure and the pressure experimentally measured in the free space of the vacuum chamber, which allows the definition of the vaporization coefficient epsilon, and the volume of the vaporization layer. The influence of the initial volume and temperature of the water on these parameters is also determined. For this purpose, a set of multivariable functions are determined from a series of experiments, with different initial water temperatures and volumes.
   The experimental set-up comprises two main components: the vacuum chamber (VC) and the depressurization system (DS). Part of the VC volume is occupied by an open container for the water, which is isolated from the VC walls. Two different containers are used having different surface areas and heights, both with a negligible heat capacity.
   The results obtained show that the functions determined for all the referred parameters are in a good agreement with the experimental results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect of natural extracts on the formation of acrylamide in fried potatoes. The aqueous extracts used were obtained from wild oregano (Origanum vulgare), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum), bougainvillea (Bougainvillea spp) and green tea (Camellia sinensis), which presented a high percentage of free radical inhibition (DPPH) (48-99%) and content of total phenolic compounds (205-547 mu g EAG/mu g of d.w.). Potatoes were submerged in the antioxidant extracts at a concentration of 1 g/L for 1 min, before being fried and their acrylamide concentration quantified by GC MS. The extracts from green tea, cinnamon and oregano reduced the acrylamide level by 62%, 39% and 17%, respectively. The potatoes submerged in cinnamon and bougainvillea extracts showed differences in the color parameters compared to the control potatoes (P < 0.05); however, no significant differences (P > 0.05) were found in the texture and the peroxide values. The sensorial evaluation showed that the acceptance of the potatoes was not affected by the treatment applied. Thus, we can conclude that pre-treating potatoes with antioxidants before frying produces beneficial effects such as a reduction in acrylamide content, without any significant changes in their physicochemical, sensorial and textural properties.

AB Aqueous suspensions prepared from native potato starch (with the concentration 4 g/100 g) were heated to temperatures of 59, 64, 69, 74, 79, 84, 89 or 94 degrees C, under continuous stirring. The resultant solutions were cooled, frozen and defrosted, and subjected to analyses.
   The heating and freezing of a potato starch suspension changed its properties, with the direction and extent of these changes depending on the temperature of pre-heating. The re-pasting of the produced starch preparations in a Brabender viscosimeter increased their viscosity to 50% compared to the pastes produced from native starch. The assayed viscosity of the pastes depended on the pre-heating temperature and was changing following the determined second degree polynomial function. The thermal characteristics (DSC) of the analyzed preparations revealed peaks that corresponded to transitions of native starch pasting and retrograded starch solubilization. The strength of the produced gels, determined with the use of an oscillatory-rotational rheometer, was greater than that of gels produced from native starch and depended on the pre-heating temperature, however these changes followed the determined second order polynomial function. Microscope preparations (SEM) of retrograded starch differed significantly in porosity that was also found to depend on the pre-heating temperature. Paste viscosity was positively correlated with the size of gel sacks determined with a laser particle size analyzer (LSA). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

(BSR) have been studied using a range of characterization methods including amylose content, water-binding capacity, paste clarity, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), amylose leaching, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and in vitro digestion. Considerable differences in these properties were observed. Amylose content varied from 16.7% to 30.5%, while paste clarity was in the range of 8.03-25.3%. Moreover, the shape of starch granules varied from spherical, elliptical to irregular or polygonal with different sizes. ADB displayed a B-type pattern, while GBL and BSR showed a C-type pattern. In addition, amylose leaching (AML) varied linearly with temperature for BSR, while the AML of other samples increased gradually below 60 degrees C, but increased dramatically beyond 60 degrees C. The three starch samples had similar gelatinization temperature ranging from 63.0 to 76.7 degrees C, but showed lower enthalpy values (0.90-3.96 J/g) than most of conventional starch. GBL and ADB possessed much higher slowly digested starch (SDS) content in vitro digestion, which made them suitable candidates for dietary starch. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of hydrothermal treatments on the properties of the natural potato was investigated. The natural potato was chosen here because it is not only used for food, but also for other, nonfood purposes. The obtained carbon nano and microstructures with different morphologies and size were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, EDX, SEM and TEM. The effects of reaction parameters, such as temperature and reaction time on the morphology and particle size of products were investigated.

AB Polyploidy is a widespread phenomenon among higher plants and a major factor shaping the structure and evolution of plant genomes. The important ornamental chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum indicum hybrid) possesses a hexaploid genome with 54 chromosomes and was classified based on its evolutionary origin and cytological methods as an allopolyploid. However, it is questionable whether cytological methods are sufficient to determine the type of ploidy, and there are more informative methods available based on molecular marker analyses. Therefore, we collected segregation data for 406 dominant molecular marker alleles [327 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLPs), 65 single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCPs) and 14 microsatellites (EST-SSRs)] in a biparental F1 population of 160 individuals. We analyzed these data for the characteristics that differ between allopolyploids and autopolyploids, including the segregation ratio of each marker, the ratio of single-dose (SD) to multi-dose (MD) markers, the ratio of SD markers in coupling to those in repulsion and the banding patterns of the SSRs. Whereas the analysis of the segregation ratio of each polymorphic marker indicated disomic (13 markers) as well as hexasomic (eight markers) inheritance, the ratio of SD markers in coupling to those in repulsion was 1:0, which is characteristic of autopolyploids. The observed ratio of SD to MD markers was 0.67:0.33 which is significantly different to the expected segregation for auto- and allohexaploids. Furthermore, the three EST-SSR alleles were inherited in all possible combinations and were not independent of each other, as expected for fixed heterozygosity in allopolyploids. Combining our results with published cytological data indicates that cultivated chrysanthemums should be classified as segmental allohexaploids.

AB Cassava starch foam (CSF) trays blended with zein, gluten, soy protein, kraft fiber, and palm oil at various concentrations: 0, 5, 10 and 15% by weight of starch, were characterized. The addition of zein and gluten into CSF resulted in consolidated and homogeneous structural foams compared to its controls. Moreover, the flexural and compressive strength increased with increasing kraft, zein and gluten. CSF containing 15% kraft gave the highest flexural and compressive strength. However, the addition of palm oil into CSF gave the lowest flexural strength and compressive strength. The observed water absorption and water solubility index of CSFs blended with 15% zein and 15% gluten protein was lowest. Although kraft, zein and gluten could improve mechanical properties, water absorption and water solubility were greater than the expanded polystyrene foam (EPS). The CSF trays in this study might be an alternative for packing low water content foods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study starches from four bean varieties viz, red, yellow, black and white, were gamma irradiated in the dose range of 5-25 kGy to investigate the effect of radiation processing on physicochemical, morphological and antioxidant properties. Studies revealed positive correlation between gamma irradiation and solubility (r = 0.91), irradiation and water absorption capacity (r = 0.82) and negative correlations between irradiation and swelling power (r = -0.92), irradiation and pasting properties (r = -0.91) and irradiation and thermal properties (r = -0.89). Microscopic observation under scanning electron microscope indicated the development of surface cracking and fractures on the surface of starch granules with increase in dose. X-ray diffractometry revealed no significant change in diffraction patterns between control and irradiated starches, except a decrease in relative crystallinity. Irradiation increased the proportions of both rapidly digestible starch and enzyme resistant starch of bean starches and significantly prevented the retrogradation of bean starches during storage. Results of the DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing power indicated significant (p <= 0.05) increase in antioxidant activity of all irradiated bean starches with increase in dose.

AB Highly exfoliated, biodegradable thermoplastic starch (TPS)/polylactic acid (PLA)/sodium montmorillonite (NaMMT) nanocomposites were prepared by an eco-friendly approach, involving in-situ gelatinization of potato starch in presence of dispersed nanoclay followed by melt mixing with PLA. The morphological analysis revealed that the NaMMT was selectively dispersed into the TPS in a highly delaminated manner. An increase in mechanical as well as thermomechanical properties was evident in the presence of PLA and more influenced in the presence of clay. The water absorption was significantly decreased in the presence of PLA (similar to 8%) itself and both PLA and clay (similar to 8-12%) in the nanocomposites. The improved mechanical properties along with its biodegradability might lead to a new green material in the area of packaging. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A series of modified starches were prepared by grafting acetylsalicylic acid (AsA) into starch by an esterification reaction then coated with poly(vinylalcohol).The structure of Starch-graft-AsA was confirmed by FTIR, NMR, and DSC. The release of AsA occurred via a retroesterification reaction of this modified coated starch (SAC) during 76h at different pHs and AsA contents. The diffusion coefficient of AsA in the SAC matrix followed a Fickian model. The effect of AsA amount grafted on starch revealed that the higher AsA amount released was reached with SAC containing 16.18mol% of AsA at pH 7.

AB The fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil is determined by a suite of biotic and abiotic factors, and disentangling their role in the complex soil interaction network remains challenging. Here, we investigate the influence of soil composition on the microbial community structure and its response to the spiked model PAH compound phenanthrene and plant litter. We used long-term matured artificial soils differing in type of clay mineral (illite, montmorillonite) and presence of charcoal or ferrihydrite. The soils received an identical soil microbial fraction and were incubated for more than two years with two sterile manure additions. The matured artificial soils and a natural soil were subjected to the following spiking treatments: (I) phenanthrene, (II) litter, (III) litter + phenanthrene, (IV) unspiked control. Total community DNA was extracted from soil sampled on the day of spiking, 7, 21, and 63 days after spiking. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacer amplicons were quantified by qPCR and subjected to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE analysis revealed that the bacterial community composition, which was strongly shaped by clay minerals after more than two years of incubation, changed in response to spiked phenanthrene and added litter. DGGE and qPCR showed that soil composition significantly influenced the microbial response to spiking. While fungal communities responded only in presence of litter to phenanthrene spiking, the response of the bacterial communities to phenanthrene was less pronounced when litter was present. Interestingly, microbial communities in all artificial soils were more strongly affected by spiking than in the natural soil, which might indicate the importance of higher microbial diversity to compensate perturbations. This study showed the influence of soil composition on the microbiota and their response to phenanthrene and litter, which may increase our understanding of complex interactions in soils for bioremediation applications.

AB The use of compost for soil amendment is a promising agricultural practice environmentally and economically viable. In the framework of a wide research project designed to evaluate the effects of soil amendment with municipal solid waste compost in comparison with traditional mineral fertilization practices, 54 different cultivars (Cvs) of potatoes were AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) molecularly fingerprinted. The seven most genetically biodiverse potato Cvs were used to establish an experimental field in southern Italy. The field area was divided into two portions fertilized with compost (20 Mg ha(-1)) or with ammonium sulphate (200 kg ha(-1)). No significant differences in productivity, organoleptic characteristics and element concentrations were observed between the potato tubers obtained with both kinds of soil fertilization, while the tubers grown on compost amended soil showed, on average, higher K concentrations with respect to those grown on mineral fertilised soil. cDNA-AFLP (complementary DNA-AFLP) and MSAP (methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism) analyses were carried out on both leaves and tubers of one selected Cv to estimate if any transcriptome alterations or epigenetic modifications were induced by the two kinds of fertilization, however no variations were detected. Chemical and biological soil qualities (i.e., microbial respiration, FDA hydrolysis, alkaline and add phosphatase) were assessed on soil samples at the start of the experiment and at the end of potato crop cycle. No significant differences in soil pH and limited ones, in the available fraction of some trace elements, were observed; while conductivity was much higher for the compost amended portion of the experimental field. Microbial respiration, FDA hydrolysis and acid phosphatase activities were significantly increased by compost amendment, in comparison with mineral fertilization. Finally, a sensory panel of potato Cvs detected no significant differences among qualitative descriptors and among potatoes coming from the two differently fertilized soils. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The dissipation kinetics and residual levels of thiamethoxam in potato and soil under field ecosystem were determined using a QuEChERS method with HPLC-DAD. At fortification levels of 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mg kg(-1), it was shown recovery was 99.4% (95.3-103.5%) for potato tubers, and 88.5% (86-91%) for soil with coefficient variation of the method (CV%) was less than 4% in potato tubers, and in soil less than 11%. For repeatability ranged from 1.27% to 4.77%. The LOD and LOQ were estimated to be 0.02 and 0.06 mg kg(-1), respectively. The half-lives were 2.92 and 1.4 days, respectively. The terminal residues of thiamethoxam were below the maximum residue limit (MRL 0.2 mg kg(-1)) after 6 days, which considered to be safe for human beings. These results contribute to establishing the scientific basis of the dosage of thiamethoxam for use in vegetable-field ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as a system for the detection of amino acids, organic acids, sugars, sugar alcohols, and fatty acids, we characterised six commercial potato cultivars (Hopehely, Katica, Lorett, Somogyi kifli, Venusz Gold, and White Lady) with different pedigrees, starch contents, cooking types, and dormancy periods, in five developmental stages from harvest to sprouting. The tubers were stored at 20-22 degrees C in the dark. The metabolite data were subjected to principal component analysis. No correlation between metabolite contents of freshly harvested tubers and starch content or cooking type of the cultivars was detected. The storage decreased the fructose and sucrose and increased the praline concentrations of tubers. Irrespective of the length of dormancy a substantial difference in metabolite composition at each time point upon storage was detected in each cultivar except Somogyi kifli, the only cultivar amongst those tested with a pure Solanum tuberosum origin and A cooking type.

AB beta,beta-Carotene 15-15 ' mono-oxygenase 1 (BCMO1) is a key enzyme in vitamin A (VitA) metabolism in mammals. Dietary compounds, such as carotenoids and polyphenols, were reported to influence BCMO1 activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hesperidin (Hes), on the VitA bioefficacy of beta-carotene (Bc) from orange-fleshed sweet potato, using Mongolian gerbils, focussing on BCMO1 activity. Gerbils (n = 50) depleted in VitA were divided into five groups fed with basal diet containing 3% white-or orange-fleshed sweet potatoes supplemented or not with Hes. Liver BCMO1 activity was low, with no significant differences between groups. Interestingly, intestinal mucosal BCMO1 activity was significantly higher in the gerbils fed without Bc or VitA than those fed with a VitA/Bc-supplemented diet. Finally, our results show that, under a low VitA status, Hes dramatically stimulated intestinal BCMO1 activity, an effect that could possibly be related to its action as an agonist of PPAR gamma.

AB Protein hydrolysates of profitable properties were prepared from the fodder potato protein concentrate. The hydrolysis process was performed with the use of commercial available enzyme (Alcalase) over a 2 and 4 h incubation period. Chemical and amino acid composition as well as functional properties of resultant hydrolysates were determined. A 2 h long process occurred profitable to obtain preparations of well balanced amino acid composition as well as proved functional properties. The industrial preparation, modified within proteolytic enzyme, totally soluble (average 98%), was characterised by fivefold higher oil holding capacity (average 5.4 cm(3)/g) and much better foam capacity (more than 150%) as compared to the material underwent modification (13.00%, 2.1 cm(3)/g and 5.33%, respectively). Presented results suggested potential use of fodder potato protein not destined directly for food purposes as the suitable product for preparations characterised by high nutritive value and functional properties.

AB Demand for organic foods is partially driven by consumers' perceptions that they are more nutritious. However, scientific opinion is divided on whether there are significant nutritional differences between organic and non-organic foods, and two recent reviews have concluded that there are no differences. In the present study, we carried out meta-analyses based on 343 peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods. Most importantly, the concentrations of a range of antioxidants such as polyphenolics were found to be substantially higher in organic crops/crop-based foods, with those of phenolic acids, flavanones, stilbenes, flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins being an estimated 19 (95% CI 5, 33) %, 69 (95% CI 13, 125) %, 28 (95% CI 12, 44) %, 26 (95% CI 3, 48) %, 50 (95% CI 28, 72)% and 51 (95% CI 17, 86)% higher, respectively. Many of these compounds have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, in dietary intervention and epidemiological studies. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues was found to be four times higher in conventional crops, which also contained significantly higher concentrations of the toxic metal Cd. Significant differences were also detected for some other (e.g. minerals and vitamins) compounds. There is evidence that higher antioxidant concentrations and lower Cd concentrations are linked to specific agronomic practices (e.g. non-use of mineral N and P fertilisers, respectively) prescribed in organic farming systems. In conclusion, organic crops, on average, have higher concentrations of antioxidants, lower concentrations of Cd and a lower incidence of pesticide residues than the non-organic comparators across regions and production seasons.

AB Fourteen new organotin(IV) complexes with general formula R2SnL2 or R3SnL where R = CH3, C2H5, C4H9, C6H5, C6H11, CH2-C6H5, C(CH3)(3), C8H17 and L = N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)]-4-oxo-4-[oxy]butanamide were synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR, NMR (H-1,C-13 and Sn-119), mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray structural analysis. Crystallographic data for four triorganotin(IV) complexes (R3SnL, R = CH3, C2H5, C4H9, CH2-C6H5) showed the tin has approximate trigonal bipyramidal geometry with the R groups in the trigonal plane. The carboxylate groups of ligands L bridge adjacent tin atoms, resulting in polymeric chains. In case of the diorganotin(IV) derivatives a six-coordinate geometry at the tin atom is proposed from spectroscopic evidence. The Me-Sn-Me bond angle in complex 7 was determined from the (2)J[Sn-119-H-1] value as 166.3 degrees that falls in the range of six-coordinate geometry. The ligand and its complexes (1-14) were screened for their antimicrobial, antitumor, cytotoxic and antileishmanial activities and found to be biologically active. The ligand and its complexes bind to DNA via intercalative interactions resulting in hypochromism and minor bathochromic shifts as confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy. Based on in vitro studies such as the potato disc method, the synthesized compounds were found to possess significant antitumor activity. Also, from cytotoxicity and DNA interaction studies, these compounds can also be used for the prevention and treatment of cancer. Gel electrophoresis assay was used to investigate the damage to double stranded super coiled plasmid pBR322 DNA by the synthesized compounds and compounds 1 and 7 were found to cause the maximum damage. All the synthesized compounds exhibit strong antileishmanial activity that was even higher than that of Amphotericin B, with significant cytotoxicity. This study, therefore, demonstrated the potential use of these compounds as source of novel agents for the treatment of leishmaniasis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, effects of boiling, steaming, microwaving, baking, and frying on proximate composition, total and individual polyphenol contents, and antioxidant activity of sweet potato leaves were investigated. An increase of 9.44% in total polyphenol content was observed after steaming, whereas decreases of 30.51, 25.70, and 15.73% were noted after boiling, microwaving, and frying, respectively. Decreases of 63.82 and 32.35% in antioxidant activity were observed after boiling and microwaving, respectively, whereas increases of 81.40, 30.09, and 85.82% in antioxidant activity were observed after steaming, baking, and frying, respectively. Eight phenolic compounds were identified in sweet potato leaves. The correlation analysis between content of individual phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity suggested that antioxidant activity could be mainly attributed to 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and 3,4,5-tri-O-caffeoylquinic acid. It was suggested that steaming is a preferred method to maintain polyphenols and antioxidant activity of sweet potato leaves.

AB The Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (CPB) is a coleopteran herbivore that feeds on the foliage on Solanum species, in particular, potato. Six resistant wild Solanum species were identified, and two of these species had low levels of glycoalkaloids. Comparative analysis of the untargeted metabolite profiles of the foliage using UPLC-qTOF-MS was done to find metabolites shared between the wild species but not with Solanum tuberosum (L.) to identify resistance-related metabolites. It was found that only S. tuberosum produced the triose glycoalkaloids solanine and chaconine. Instead, the six wild species produced glycoalkaloids that shared in common tetrose sugar side chains. Additionally, there were non-glycoalkaloid metabolites associated with resistance including hydroxycoumarin and a phenylpropanoid, which were produced in all wild species but not in S. tuberosum.

AB The plant-specific insert is an approximately 100-residue domain found exclusively within the C-terminal lobe of some plant aspartic proteases. Structurally, this domain is a member of the saposin-like protein family, and is involved in plant pathogen defense as well as vacuolar targeting of the parent protease molecule. Similar to other members of the saposin-like protein family, most notably saposins A and C, the recently resolved crystal structure of potato (Solanum tuberosum) plant-specific insert has been shown to exist in a substrate-bound open conformation in which the plant-specific insert oligomerizes to form homodimers. In addition to the open structure, a closed conformation also exists having the classic saposin fold of the saposin-like protein family as observed in the crystal structure of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) plant-specific insert. In the present study, the mechanisms of tertiary and quaternary conformation changes of potato plant-specific insert were investigated in silico as a function of pH. Umbrella sampling and determination of the free energy change of dissociation of the plant-specific insert homodimer revealed that increasing the pH of the system to near physiological levels reduced the free energy barrier to dissociation. Furthermore, principal component analysis was used to characterize conformational changes at both acidic and neutral pH. The results indicated that the plant-specific insert may adopt a tertiary structure similar to the characteristic saposin fold and suggest a potential new structural motif among saposin-like proteins. To our knowledge, this acidified PSI structure presents the first example of an alternative saposin-fold motif for any member of the large and diverse SAPLIP family.

AB Brown rot, caused by Monilinia fructicola, Monilinia fructigena, Monilinia laxa, Monilia polystroma, and Monilia yunnanensis, is an important disease of stone and pome fruits. The conidia of these fungi commonly form on infected tissues and serve as the main inoculum source throughout the growing season. Epidemiological research, such as fruit inoculation, often requires a large quantity of inocula. However, the sporulation of M. fructigena, M. polystroma, and M. yunnanensis on artificial media is inferior to that of M. fructicola and M. laxa. In this study we compared the sporulation of these species on potato dextrose agar (PDA), cherry juice agar (CA), oatmeal tomato agar (OTA), rye tomato juice agar (RTA) and apple fruits, and developed an efficient conidial production method on PDA for these fungi. In this method, a regular PDA plate was inoculated by spreading mycelial fragments of the fungi on the surface and incubated at 22 A degrees C for approximately 2.5 days in the dark. Then, the mycelia were scraped and washed off using sterilized distilled water. The surface of the medium was then covered with two layers of gauze and incubated at 22 A degrees C for between 36 and 48 h. Without scraping, the range of sporulation on PDA per plate was sparse to 10(3) conidia, while with scraping it increased to 10(6)-10(7) conidia per plate. On apple fruit, the range of sporulation was sparse to 10(5) conidia per fruit depending on the isolates used. This scraping method led to the abundant production of conidia from brown rot fungi on the medium.

AB Micronutrient malnutrition is a global health problem. An improved understanding of the genetic variation of important micronutrient traits within a potato breeding population will help devise breeding strategies for the biofortification of this important food staple. The dataset consisted of 556 individuals from 17 full-sib diploid families grown in 2006 in Huanuco, Peru, and 1329 individuals from 32 full-sib families grown in 2009 in Ayacucho, Peru. Genetic parameters were estimated using univariate and multivariate individual Bayesian models for micronutrient tuber content including Fe and Zn. Genetic variance was additive and heritability estimates were moderate (0.36 to 0.57) and inflated if the common environment of full-sibs was not taken into account. Posterior modes of genetic correlation estimates between minerals, when analyzed on a dry-weight basis, were all positive (0.04 to 0.72) and between minerals and tuber dry matter were negative (-0.14 to -0.38). On a fresh-weight basis, genetic correlations between minerals and tuber dry matter were small but positive (0.05 to 0.18). The implications and challenges for selective breeding to enhance micronutrient content in potato tubers are discussed.

AB Crop biofortification with Se is widely accepted. However, little is known about the efficiency of selenomethionine (Se-Met) incorporation into the seed and tuber protein fraction of crops. Here, we report on the efficiency of Se incorporation into the seed and tuber protein fraction of soybean, flax, and potato and the putative identity of some of the proteins that are likely targets for this random pretranslation modification. Soybean, flax, and potato plants received Se using different sodium selenate application methods and rates, and Se-Met was determined in seed, tuber, and their protein fractions. Selenium content in seed and tuber tissues and in protein fractions was increased by 2 to 86 times. The methionine (Met) pool was increased, as was the proportion of Se-Met in the Met pool, but the ratio of Se-Met:total Met was well conserved (1:1) between the treated and nontreated plants. After two-dimensional (2D) protein electrophoresis, five protein spots were identified as glycinin, trypsin inhibitor (soybean), patatin-3-Kuras-1, patain-B2, and phosphoenol carboxy kinase (potato), none of which showed S to Se substitution in their primary structure. Linking Se and three stress markers in fresh tuber extracts, glutathione (GSH) level, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were increased by 20 to 35%. The data showed low protein modification in these non-Se-accumulator crops and indicated that rates of 5 to 10 g ha(-1) Se, through foliar application, may ensure not only an adequate daily intake levels for humans but may also activate antioxidant enzyme systems within the tuber tissue.

AB Monacolin K (MK) is a naturally occurring hypocholesterolemic agent that specifically inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. As a natural source of MK, Monascus-fermented products are of special interest; however, some Monascus strains could produce citrinin, which is a nephrotoxin, as a contaminant in Monascus-derived products. A Monascus pilosus strain (MS-1) that produces high amounts of MK, but no citrinin, was screened in previous investigations. Herein, liquid-state fermentation parameters of the MS-1 strain were optimized using statistical methods to maximize the MK yield with potato juice as a basic medium. The maximum MK yield (326.74g/mL) was predicted with 50 mL of medium in a 250-mL conical flask containing 30 g/L sucrose, 38.75 g/L soybean flour, 0.00105 mol/L Mg2+ at pH 5.48, and 8% v/v seed inoculum precultured for 42 h at 30 degrees C, incubated at 30 degrees C for 3 days, followed by further incubation for 11 days at 24.7 degrees C. The verified MK yield was 390.68g/mL and the MK yield increased to 565.64g/mL after 21 days of fermentation. No citrinin was detected in MS-1-fermented products. The results suggest that citrinin-free MK can be obtained from natural medium through liquid-state fermentation in an economical way. This method will be of practical value to the industrial production of MK.

AB In Sub-Saharan Africa, drying maize on their stem was the traditional technique frequently used; this technique must be improved to avoid contaminations and to increase the quality of drying. However, the method of storage is accountable for the most significant losses after harvest, because mildew develops when the conditions of storage (too high temperature and moisture of the air) do not tally with the final content of the dried product. Sorption isotherms of products are most important to model moisture uptake during storage and distribution. Sorption isotherms of intermediate moisture content maize grains were determined using the gravimetric static method of saturated salt solutions at 30 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 50 degrees C, and 60 degrees C, and GAB equation was applied to discuss the results. This model correctly describes the evolutions of maize sorption isotherms, with maximum deviation of 0.0080 kg water/kg db. The net isosteric heat of sorption was determined also, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, and it was varied from 463 kJ/kg to 1,264 kJ/kg, decreasing with increasing moisture content. This effect was well described by an exponential function with a regression coefficient R-2 > 97%. The monolayer moisture content was found to decrease with increasing temperature. These results can be used to predict the potential changes in the stability of maize grains and later for the development of a system of suitable drying.

AB The aim was to evaluate the effects of feeding resistant potato starch (RPS) as a natural source of resistant starch to weaned pigs for 28 d immediately after weaning. Sixty piglets (Yorkshire-Landrace x Duroc) weaned at 21 +/- 2 d (1:1 male:female) with an initial BW of 7.2 +/- 0.78 kg were assigned in a completely randomized design to 1 of 5 dietary treatments to give 6 observations per treatment and 2 pigs per pen. Dietary treatments consisted of a negative control corn-soybean meal-wheat-wheat middlings-based diet (NC; no antimicrobial agents added) or the NC supplemented with RPS either as powder or in capsules and each included at 0.5 or 1.0% as a top-dressing on each day. Diets were formulated to meet 1998 NRC specifications. Pigs were offered the experimental diets on an ad libitum basis for 28 d and water was available at all times. The ADG, ADFI, and G:F were determined weekly. Fecal score was determined daily for 14 d after weaning. At the conclusion of study, 1 pig from each pen was randomly selected and euthanized (n = 6 per treatment) to determine visceral organ weight, digesta pH, VFA, and ammonia N (NH3-N) concentrations. Resistant potato starch supplementation improved (P < 0.001) fecal score, and pigs offered 1.0% RPS had more solid feces (P < 0.05) than those offered 0.5% RPS during the first 14 d after weaning, independent of the form of RPS. Resistant potato starch supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) ileal and cecal digesta pH regardless of the levels of RPS or mode of delivery. The total VFA concentrations in cecal digesta were greater (P < 0.05) but the molar proportion of branched-chain fatty acids were lower (P < 0.05) for pigs fed the RPS-containing diets compared with those fed the NC, irrespective of the RPS levels or the form of RPS. However, there were no differences (P > 0.10) in visceral organ weights, growth performance, and digestibilities of DM, CP, Ca, and P among treatments. The results of this experiment indicate that supplementing a weaner pig diet with at least 0.5% RPS independent of mode of delivery has the potential to enhance outcomes characteristic of a functional gut in weaned pigs without adverse effects on growth.

AB Modeling Hawaiian dryland (rainfed) agriculture has been an effective means for examining interactions between ecosystems and human behavior. Dryland agriculture in these discussions has often been treated as a homogenous farming system; however, this was in fact a dynamic system with distinct agroecological zones where specific mixes of crops were grown using different farming methods. We examine this variability by using historical depictions and ground surveys to estimate the extent of an agroecological zone represented by breadfruit plantations within Kona, Hawaii Island. We estimate that the plantations produced 21,200-58,400 mt/yr of breadfruit on 3100-5900 ha with a likely canopy cover within the plantations of 38-73%. Our models suggest that yields per area in the plantation ranged from 1.96 to 3.61 dry mt/ha. Given the yield and labor requirements, breadfruit could have produced a caloric surplus for 15 people in contrast to 3.6 people under assumed requirements of sweet potato. This high surplus would have been vital for socio-political developments centered in the region, and highlights the importance of assessing variability of dryland field systems in discussion of their role in historical trajectories.

AB Physicochemical properties of composite flours made of wheat from low to high protein contents and canna or konjac at different levels of substitution (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 %) were prepared and analyzed. Compared to that of wheat flour alone, increasing levels of canna inclusions significantly increased the amount of resistant starch (RS) but decreased the protein content of composite flours. This substitution did not alter the total starch (TS), amylase and amylopectin contents of these mixtures. Changes in physicochemical properties were also observed in wheat-konjac composite flours. Increasing amounts of konjac flour decreased the TS, amylase, amylopectin, and protein content of the mixtures, but increased the amount of RS. Substitution of wheat flour with 75 % of canna or konjac flours in HPWC (High Protein Wheat-Canna), HPWK (High Protein Wheat-Konjac), and LPWK (Low Protein Wheat-Konjac) increased the swelling power of these mixtures at 80 and 90 A degrees C. In general, substitution of wheat flour with up to 50 % of canna or konjac flours did not cause any other observable decline. In addition, the substitution of wheat flour with canna or konjac flours increased the gelatinization temperature of all composite flours.

AB Extruded RTE snacks were prepared from flour blends made with corn flour, Bengal gram flour, roots and tuber flours in a proportion of 60-80: 20: 20 respectively and moisture was adjusted to 17-20 %. The roots and tubers flours were developed from potato (Solanum tuberosum), yam (Dioscorea spp.), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.), taro (Colocassia esculenta) and beet root (Beta vulgaris). Different formulations were extruded at 80 +/- 5 A degrees C (heater I) and 95-105 A degrees C (heater II) temperature, 300-350 rpm screw speed, 100 A +/- 10 A degrees C die temperature and 15 A +/- 2 kg/h feed rate. The exit diameter of the circular die was 3 mm. Sensory acceptability, physical parameters and nutrient analysis along with storage stability of the products was conducted. The fiber and energy content of the RTE extruded snack improved in experimental samples prepared using root and tuber flours. A serving of 100 g of the snack can provide more than 400 Kcal and 10 g of protein. The overall acceptability of RTE extruded products made with potato and taro were highly acceptable compared to yam and sweet potato. The study demonstrates utilization of roots and tuber flours as potential and diverse ingredients to enhance the appearance and nutritional properties in RTE extruded snack.

AB Convenient, ready-to consume thermally processed potato stuffed parothas retaining their natural sensory attributes have been developed. Response Surface Methodology was used to optimize the Stuffing: dough ratio along with other ingredients. Optimized Stuffed parothas were packed in indigenously developed retortable pouches and processed in a steam-air retort. The time-temperature history was recorded during heat processing using an Ellab data cum Fo recorder. The total processing time was 25 min with a Fo value of 3.5. The quality of the developed product was evaluated chemically, sensorily and microbiologically to assess the shelf-life. After 12 months of storage, peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid value (TBA) and free fatty acid value (FFA) increases significantly (p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.05) from 9.98 to 29.16 meqO(2)/Kg fat, 0.101 to 0.171 mg MA/Kg sample and 1.01 to 2.66 % oleic acid respectively. The chemical changes and overall acceptability scores were found to be negatively correlated during storage. Textural and colour values also had an impact on the sensory scores of stuffed parothas during storage. After 12 months of storage, sensory scores decreases significantly (p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.05) from 8.6 to 7.1 on a nine point hedonic scale. Microbiologically stuffed parothas remained stable during entire period of storage.

AB A field experiment was conducted during 2010-11 and 2011-12 on sandy loam soil at Uttar Chandamari village of Nadia district of West Bengal (22 degrees 57' N latitude, 88 degrees 20' E longitude) to study the effects of seaweed saps on crop growth and yield vis-a-vis nutrient uptake by the crops under rice-potato-greengram sequence. The foliar application of seaweed extracts (namely Kappaphycus and Gracilaria) at different concentrations (0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 and 15.0% v/v) significantly enhanced the growth, yield and nutrient uptake by the crops in sequence. The application of 15% Kappaphycus sap along with recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) recorded the highest productivity in terms of rice equivalent yield (REY) with net monetary returns of Rs. 175608.60 ha(-1) yr(-1) and benefit: cost ratio of 2.06.

AB A simple and rapid chromatographic method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of five phenolic acids including Gallic acid, Chloroganic acid, Syringic acid, Benzoic acid and Vanillic acid by HPLC with UV-VIS detector. These Phenolic acids were separated by analytical column Intersil ODS-3 C18; a gradient elution system of ACN and acidified water solution with 1ml/min flow rate and quantified in a total run of 30 minutes at 210nm wavelength. In the quantitative analysis of these compounds showed good regression (0.995-0.999). The limit of detection [LOD] and limit of quantification [LOQ] of these compounds were in the range of 0.15-0.46 and 0.42-2.47 mu g/ml. The average recoveries were between 95.8-103.1% and their RSD values were less than 3.34%. By the proposed method Gallic acid, Chloroganic acid and Syringic acid were found and quantified in Methanolic, Ethanolic and Acetonic extract of Ocimum sanctum Linn. leaves. While the two other phenolic acids benzoic acid and vanillic acid was not found in the extracts of Ocimum sanctum Linn. leaves.

AB Effects of sugar alcohol (maltitol, erythritol, and xylitol) at different concentration levels (sugar alcohol/starch ratio 0.1:1, 0.2:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, w/w, db) on the physicochemical properties of wheat starch were studied. The swelling power decreased significantly with sugar alcohols content increasing at 95 degrees C. Rapid visco-analyser (RVA) breakdown and setback of wheat starch decreased with increasing sugar alcohol content. Texture measurements showed that hardness of wheat starch gel rose with increasing content of sugar alcohols, indicating that sugar alcohols probably facilitated the retrogradation of amylose following the order of xylitol>maltitol>erythritol at a sugar alcohol/starch ratio of 2:1. The gelatinization temperature and enthalpy of wheat starch increased significantly at higher maltitol, erythritol, and xylitol concentrations (1:1). Such effects might be contributed to more hydrogen bonds formed between sugar alcohols hydroxyl groups and starch chains and the granule needed greater energy to break away during gelatinization.

AB Common cattail (Typha latifolia) is a wetland plant that is widespread all over the world. All of its morphological parts are edible, but the rhizome is the most valuable. Its starch content can be up to 70% of the dry mass; however, its structure and functionality have not yet been described. The aim of this study was to characterise the structure of cattail rhizome starch. The rhizome of common cattail was harvested in the spring from a natural pond. The starch was isolated by grinding and washing away the fibre fraction. Sonication was used to disintegrate the cell walls. The structure of starch granules was studied using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and wide angle X-ray scattering method (WAXS). The molecular mass distribution of the starch macromolecules was analysed with gel permeation chromatography using triple detection and compared to results of corn and potato starches. The granules of the cattail starch were predominantly round shaped and had a typical Gaussian distribution of size characterised by a mode value of 9 mu m. The WAXS investigation proved that the granules had a C type crystal structure, which was a combination of A and B polymorphs contributing 28.3 and 71.7%, respectively. The cattail starch contained 32% amylose. Its molecular mass was significantly higher than potato starch but slightly lower than corn starch. The molecular mass of cattail amylopectin was between corn and potato starch. Its structure was the most branched compared to all the starches investigated.

AB The salt-induced crystallization behavior of potato amylose was probed by measurement of fluorescent inversive microscope, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The crystalline patterns and granular structures of potato amylose in the presence of salt were highly dependent on the type and concentration of salt as well as the amylose content. High amylose content and low salt concentration (specifically 4% of amylose content and below 0.1mol/L of salt in this study) favored the organization of double-stranded helices into regular assemblies. Salt was proposed to act on the crystallization of potato amylose mainly via the cation-starch interactions occurring between the cations of salt and the negatively charged phosphate groups and free hydroxyl groups of potato amylose. The difference in the crystalline growth mode of potato amylose with different concentrations might be attributed to different nature of cations, especially the charge density.

AB Acid-thinned wheat, potato, and pea starch products were systematically prepared applying gentle conditions with variation of acid type (HCl and H2SO4), acid concentration (0.36 and 0.72N in a 40% (w/w) suspension) as well as hydrolysis time (4 and 24h). Starch granule properties as well as molecular and rheological characteristics in the solution state were analyzed and the impact of all parameters varied was found to be immense. Carbohydrate solubilization of wheat and potato starch was significantly higher compared to pea starch. Noteworthy progress in solubilization was found when hydrolyzed with HCl, and with increasing acid concentration and increasing hydrolysis time by trend. The hydrolysis affected the reduction of the hot paste viscosity most dominant in the first period of treatment (0-4h), however, size exclusion chromatography-multi angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis revealed a more prominent molecular degradation during the second period (4-24h). This observation led to the interpretation that the molecular degradation in the initial phase results particularly in debranching of the high molar mass amylopectin fraction and lower hot paste viscosity. Continued hydrolysis with significant reduction of the molecular size, however, had reduced impact on further lowering of viscosity. SEM micrographs displayed intact pea starch granules with unchanged surface after hydrolysis, whereas wheat and potato starch granules were visibly affected with damage not evenly distributed but a variation over the granule population. Granular wheat and potato starch exhibited significantly enhanced particle size after short period modification measured in water. However, this was found eliminated at extended hydrolysis time. Reasons were hydrolysis induced molecular rearrangement resulting in better crystalline packing on the amorphous/crystalline threshold reducing the ability to swell, and the progress in granular erosion. That was in line with changed swelling characteristics determined using DSC. The study gave evidence for strong impact of acid hydrolysis on functional properties like water binding.

Genomic data have provided valuable insights into the molecular clock, allowing the patterns and causes of evolutionary rate variation to be characterized in increasing detail. I explain how genome sequences offer exciting opportunities for estimating the timescale of the Tree of Life. I describe the different approaches that have been used to deal with the computational and statistical challenges encountered in molecular clock analyses of genomic data. Finally, I offer a perspective on the future of molecular clocks, highlighting some of the key limitations and the most promising research directions.

AB Agricultural land use allocation involves assessment of land potential as well as land demand for various crops to identify the optimum land unit for each type. Current allocation models often focus on the perspective of increase in land demand. However, processes causing loss of arable land should be considered to correct the demand used in conventional allocation processes. In order to achieve that, a two stage model for crop allocation is presented which uses different models such as cellular automata, Markov chain, fuzzy rule-based system, goal programming and GIS raster analysis in a logical framework. In the presented model, at first by considering environmental (soil erosion and soil salinity) and economic (urban expansion) factors leading to arable land loss, agricultural use of each land unit is allocated. Next, crop types within the agricultural area are determined based on land suitability evaluation and demand assessment for each crop. This model is developed for rural land use planning on a regional scale and is applied to the Borkhar and Meymeh district in Isfahan province in Iran to predict land use map of 2015. The overall accuracy of 0.609 in the first step allowed us to draw conclusion that the inclusion of factors resulting farmland decline in allocation process gives more accurate results than the former allocation techniques which merely model factors causing increase in agricultural land areas. Moreover, according to the results for 2015, 27.82%, 21.64%, 7.27%, 5.85%, 7.36%, 6.36% and 1.74% of agricultural areas is allocated to wheat, wheat-maize, barley, barley-maize, maize, alfalfa and potato, respectively. The presented approach has advantageous to determine the crops with highest suitability for a given area according to the desired objectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB cDNAs coding for a mature form of glutenin-hydrolyzing trypsin-like proteinase (referred to as glutenin-hydrolyzing proteinase 3 or GHP3) from the insect pest Eurygaster integriceps Put. and a zymogen of this proteinase containing a signal peptide required for protein secretion were cloned into vectors pPIC9 and pPIC3.5, respectively. The constructs were used for protein expression in cells of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant protein corresponding to the mature form of the proteinase was secreted into the culture medium and possessed proteolytic activity, while the zymogen acquired activity after trypsin treatment. Both recombinant enzymes hydrolyzed high-molecular weight glutenin subunits from wheat of the variety Ege-88 and a range of other soft and durum wheat varieties. Chymotrypsin inhibitor I from potatoes and related inhibitors from seeds of plants of the subclass Asteridae, the Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor from soybeans, and bovine aprotinin had a weak inhibitory effect on the recombinant proteinases, while the Bowman-Birk trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitor from soybeans did not interact with these enzymes.

AB 'Suioh', a sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) cultivar developed in Japan, has edible leaves and stems. The sweet potato leaves contain polyphenols such as caffeoylquinic acid (CQA) derivatives. It has multiple biological functions and may help to regulate the blood glucose concentration. In this study, we first examined whether sweet potato leaf extract powder (SP) attenuated hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetic mice. Administration of dietary SP for 5 weeks significantly lowered glycaemia in type 2 diabetic mice. Second, we conducted in vitro experiments, and found that SP and CQA derivatives significantly enhanced glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. Third, pre-administration of SP significantly stimulated GLP-1 secretion and was accompanied by enhanced insulin secretion in rats, which resulted in a reduced glycaemic response after glucose injection. These results indicate that oral SP attenuates postprandial hyperglycaemia, possibly through enhancement of GLP-1 secretion.

AB Climate Change is likely to increase the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration and timing of weather and climate extremes and can result in unprecedented extremes. Managed systems like agriculture are not immune to them. Studying the rapidly growing body of climate change literature it has been noted that there are only a few papers concerning the influences of extreme weather on agriculture. Projections of future impacts of extreme weather cannot always be made with a high level of confidence. Pests (weeds, insect pests and plant pathogens) represent a major constraint to crop production. The present paper analyses scientific literature published since 1945 concerning the knowledge about the influences of extreme weather on incidence of pests in wheat, barley, maize, beet, potato, rape, forage crops and grassland. Only 63 papers were found. Insect pests and plant pathogenic fungi of maize and wheat are most investigated. The most papers describe the influences of drought, dryness heat and heavy down pours. There are enormously knowledge gaps. On the basis of this it is not possible to assess the influences of weather extremes in a changing climate on pests and yield loss current. More research in this field is needed urgently.

AB Competence for phototropic (PT) and gravitropic (GT) bending by potato plantlets grown in vitro manifests regular daily changes indicating possible involvement of circadian regulation. Unilateral stimulation of plantlets with blue light at dawn resulted in moderate PT response regarding both attained curvature and long lag phase. The PT response was the strongest between 8:00 and 12:00 h. Throughout the afternoon and in the evening, bending rate and maximal PT curvature declined significantly until 23:00 h. The GT response was fastest and strongest for plantlets stimulated early in the morning and late in the evening. During the rest of the day, GT competence did not change much apart from a minimum at 15:00. In conditions comprising either prolonged day or prolonged night, plantlets appeared to maintain rhythmicity of competence for PT and GT at least in the short-term. Introduction of a dark period prior to the tropic stimulation at 11:00 h when both PT and GT responses were strong resulted in the opposite effect: PT was depressed, and GT was enhanced. There was a time threshold of 60 min for the duration of the dark period so the plants can sense interruption in the daylight. Levels of relative expression of a PHOT2 gene indicate rhythmic daily changes. The PHOT2 gene was present at high levels during morning hours and late in the evening. As the mid-day and the afternoon hours approached, PHOT2 expression decreased and reached a daily minimum at 17:00 h. We believe that our data offer strong support for the conclusion that there is an involvement of circadian rhythms in control of both PT and GT.

AB Background and aims: Increased potassium intake is related to reduced blood pressure (BP) and reduced stroke rate. The effect of increased dietary potassium on endothelial function remains unknown. The aim was to determine the effect of increased dietary potassium from fruit and vegetables on endothelial function.
   Methods and results: Thirty five healthy men and women (age 32 +/- 12 y) successfully completed a randomised cross-over study of 2 x 6 day diets either high or low in potassium. Flow mediated dilatation (FMD), BP, pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AI) and a fasting blood sample for analysis of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and endothelin-1 were taken on completion of each intervention. Dietary change was achieved by including bananas and potatoes in the high potassium and apples and rice/pasta in the low potassium diet. Dietary adherence was assessed using 6 day weighed food diaries and a 24 h urine sample. The difference in potassium excretion between the two diets was 48 + 32 mmol/d (P = 0.000). Fasting FMD was significantly improved by 0.6% + 1.5% following the high compared to the low potassium diet (P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in BP, PWV, AI, ICAM-1, ADMA or endothelin-1 between the interventions. There was a significant reduction in E-selectin following the high (Median = 5.96 ng/ml) vs the low potassium diet (Median = 6.24 ng/ml), z = -2.49, P = 0.013.
   Conclusion: Increased dietary potassium from fruit and vegetables improves FMD within 1 week in healthy men and women but the mechanisms for this effect remain unclear. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB This study assessed the effects of thermal (40, 60, 80, 100 and 127 A degrees C) and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP, 200, 400 and 600 MPa) treatments on the in vitro digestibility and structural properties of sweet potato protein (SPP). The results showed that the in vitro digestibility of SPP increased significantly with increasing heating temperature and heating time (0-60 min), while HHP treatment had little or no effect. Native SPP denaturation temperature (T (d) ) and enthalpy change (Delta H) were 89.0 A degrees C and 9.6 J/g, respectively. Thermal and HHP treated SPP had T (d) of 84.6-88.9 A degrees C and 86.4-87.6 A degrees C, respectively. Delta H of thermal treated SPP was 3.6-6.4 J/g, while that of HHP treated SPP was 5.9-7.8 J/g. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results demonstrated that HHP and thermal treatments both significantly reduced SPP thermodynamic stability. Circular dichroism analyses revealed that native SPP contains alpha-helixes, beta-sheets and random coils (4.3, 48.0 and 47.7 %, respectively). After thermal treatment at 127 A degrees C for 20 min, the content of alpha-helixes and turns increased significantly (13.2 and 27.6 %, respectively), whereas the content of beta-sheets decreased significantly (12.3 %). In contrast, HHP treatment increased the content of beta-sheets, but decreased the content of random coils. This study suggested that the SPP structure changes might be the main reason affecting the in vitro digestibility of SPP, and thermal treatment was more effective at changing SPP secondary structures and improving in vitro SPP digestibility than HHP treatment.

AB The development of high-yielding varieties with broad-spectrum durable disease resistance is the ultimate goal of crop breeding. In plants, immune receptors of the nucleotide-binding-leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) class mediate race-specific resistance against pathogen attack. When employed in agriculture this type of resistance is often rapidly overcome by newly adapted pathogen races. The stacking of different resistance genes or alleles in F1 hybrids or in pyramided lines is a promising strategy for achieving more durable resistance. Here, we identify a molecular mechanism which can negatively interfere with the allele-pyramiding approach. We show that pairwise combinations of different alleles of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm3 in F1 hybrids and stacked transgenic wheat lines can result in suppression of Pm3-based resistance. This effect is independent of the genetic background and solely dependent on the Pm3 alleles. Suppression occurs at the post-translational level, as levels of RNA and protein in the suppressed alleles are unaffected. Using a transient expression system in Nicotiana benthamiana, the LRR domain was identified as the domain conferring suppression. The results of this study suggest that the expression of closely related NB-LRR resistance genes or alleles in the same genotype can lead to dominant-negative interactions. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the frequently observed ineffectiveness of resistance genes introduced from the secondary gene pool into polyploid crop species and mark an important step in overcoming this limitation.

AB Dense linkage maps derived by analysing SNP dosage in autotetraploids provide detailed information about the location of, and genetic model at, quantitative trait loci.
   Recent developments in sequencing and genotyping technologies enable researchers to generate high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data for mapping studies. For polyploid species, the SNP genotypes are informative about allele dosage, and Hackett et al. (PLoS ONE 8:e63939, 2013) presented theory about how dosage information can be used in linkage map construction and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for an F-1 population in an autotetraploid species. Here, QTL mapping using dosage information is explored for simulated phenotypic traits of moderate heritability and possibly non-additive effects. Different mapping strategies are compared, looking at additive and more complicated models, and model fitting as a single step or by iteratively re-weighted modelling. We recommend fitting an additive model without iterative re-weighting, and then exploring non-additive models for the genotype means estimated at the most likely position. We apply this strategy to re-analyse traits of high heritability from a potato population of 190 F-1 individuals: flower colour, maturity, height and resistance to late blight (Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary) and potato cyst nematode (Globodera pallida), using a map of 3839 SNPs. The approximate confidence intervals for QTL locations have been improved by the detailed linkage map, and more information about the genetic model at each QTL has been revealed. For several of the reported QTLs, candidate SNPs can be identified, and used to propose candidate trait genes. We conclude that the high marker density is informative about the genetic model at loci of large effects, but that larger populations are needed to detect smaller QTLs.

AB Genome-wide QTL analysis of potato tuber carotenoid content was investigated in populations of Solanum tuberosum Group Phureja that segregate for flesh colour, revealing a novel major QTL on chromosome 9.
   The carotenoid content of edible plant storage organs is a key nutritional and quality trait. Although the structural genes that encode the biosynthetic enzymes are well characterised, much less is known about the factors that determine overall storage organ content. In this study, genome-wide QTL mapping, in concert with an efficient 'genetical genomics' analysis using bulked samples, has been employed to investigate the genetic architecture of potato tuber carotenoid content. Two diploid populations of Solanum tuberosum Group Phureja were genotyped (AFLP, SSR and DArT markers) and analysed for their tuber carotenoid content over two growing seasons. Common to both populations were QTL that explained relatively small proportions of the variation in constituent carotenoids and a major QTL on chromosome 3 explaining up to 71 % of the variation in carotenoid content. In one of the populations (01H15), a second major carotenoid QTL was identified on chromosome 9, explaining up to 20 % of the phenotypic variation. Whereas the major chromosome 3 QTL was likely to be due to an allele of a gene encoding beta-carotene hydroxylase, no known carotenoid biosynthetic genes are located in the vicinity of the chromosome 9 QTL. A unique expression profiling strategy using phenotypically distinct bulks comprised individuals with similar carotenoid content provided further support for the QTL mapping to chromosome 9. This study shows the potential of using the potato genome sequence to link genetic maps to data arising from eQTL approaches to enhance the discovery of candidate genes underlying QTLs.

TI Interaction Patterns between Potato Virus Y and eIF4E-Mediated Recessive
   Resistance in the Solanaceae

AB The structural pattern of infectivity matrices, which contains infection data resulting from inoculations of a set of hosts by a set of parasites, is a key parameter for our understanding of biological interactions and their evolution. This pattern determines the evolution of parasite pathogenicity and host resistance, the spatiotemporal distribution of host and parasite genotypes, and the efficiency of disease control strategies. Two major patterns have been proposed for plant-virus genotype infectivity matrices. In the gene-for-gene model, infectivity matrices show a nested pattern, where the host ranges of specialist virus genotypes are subsets of the host ranges of less specialized viruses. In contrast, in the matching-allele (MA) model, each virus genotype is specialized to infect one (or a small set of) host genotype(s). The corresponding infectivity matrix shows a modular pattern where infection is frequent for plants and viruses belonging to the same module but rare for those belonging to different modules. We analyzed the structure of infectivity matrices between Potato virus Y (PVY) and plant genotypes in the family Solanaceae carrying different eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-coding alleles conferring recessive resistance. Whereas this system corresponds mechanistically to an MA model, the expected modular pattern was rejected based on our experimental data. This was mostly because PVY mutations involved in adaptation to a particular plant genotype displayed frequent pleiotropic effects, conferring simultaneously an adaptation to additional plant genotypes with different eIF4E alleles. Such effects should be taken into account for the design of strategies of sustainable control of PVY through plant varietal mixtures or rotations.
   IMPORTANCE
   The interaction pattern between host and virus genotypes has important consequences on their respective evolution and on issues regarding the application of disease control strategies. We found that the structure of the interaction between Potato virus Y (PVY) variants and host plants in the family Solanaceae departs significantly from the current model of interaction considered for these organisms because of frequent pleiotropic effects of virus mutations. These mutational effects allow the virus to expand rapidly its range of host plant genotypes, make it very difficult to predict the effects of mutations in PVY infectivity factors, and raise concerns about strategies of sustainable management of plant genetic resistance to viruses.

TI A Novel Role of the Potyviral Helper Component Proteinase Contributes To
   Enhance the Yield of Viral Particles

AB The helper component proteinase (HCPro) is an indispensable, multifunctional protein of members of the genus Potyvirus and other viruses of the family Potyviridae. This viral factor is directly involved in diverse steps of viral infection, such as aphid transmission, polyprotein processing, and suppression of host antiviral RNA silencing. In this paper, we show that although a chimeric virus based on the potyvirus Plum pox virus lacking HCPro, which was replaced by a heterologous silencing suppressor, caused an efficient infection in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, its viral progeny had very reduced infectivity. Making use of different approaches, here, we provide direct evidence of a previously unknown function of HCPro in which the viral factor enhances the stability of its cognate capsid protein (CP), positively affecting the yield of virions and consequently improving the infectivity of the viral progeny. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the ability of HCPro to stabilize CP and enhance the yield of infectious viral particles is not linked to any of its previously known activities and helped us to delimit the region of HCPro involved in this function in the central region of the protein. Moreover, the function is highly specific and cannot be fulfilled by the HCPro of a heterologous potyvirus. The importance of this novel requirement in regulating the sorting of the viral genome to be subjected to replication, translation, and encapsidation, thus contributing to the synchronization of these viral processes, is discussed.
   IMPORTANCE
   Potyviruses form one of the most numerous groups of plant viruses and are a major cause of crop loss worldwide. It is well known that these pathogens make use of virus-derived multitasking proteins, as well as dedicated host factors, to successfully infect their hosts. Here, we describe a novel requirement for the proper yield and infectivity of potyviral progeny. In this case, such a function is performed by the extensively studied viral factor HCPro, which seems to use an unknown mechanism that is not linked to its previously described activities. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a factor different from capsid protein (CP) has been shown to be directly involved in the yield of potyviral particles. Based on the data presented here, we hypothesize that this capacity of HCPro might be involved in the coordination of mutually exclusive activities of the viral genome by controlling correct assembly of CP in stable virions.

AB This study aimed to examine the effects of seven different isothiocyanates against the growth and development of three important soil borne potato pathogens, (Colletotrichum coccodes, Rhizoctonia solani and Helminthosporium solani).
   The study was carried out using an agar diffusion assay. The radial growth of fungal pathogens grown on agar containing different ITCs at a range of concentrations was compared to that of growth on control agar plates that did not contain ITCs.
   Results varied depending on the specific isothiocyanate incorporated into the agar. They ranged from those which showed a significant effect on fungal growth to those which appeared to have little or no effect. Where a suppressive effect was observed, due to the presence of the isothiocyanate, fungal colony growth decreased as the concentration of the incorporated isothiocyanate increased.
   Results from this study indicate that fungal growth can be inhibited by exposure to ITCs. However the results observed are specific to the ITC structure and exposure concentration.

AB Potato Rpi-blb2 encodes a protein with a coiled-coil-nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) motif that recognizes the Phytophthora infestans AVRblb2 effector and triggers hypersensitive cell death (HCD). To better understand the components required for Rpi-blb2-mediated HCD in plants, we used virus-induced gene silencing to repress candidate genes in Rpi-blb2-transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants and assayed the plants for AVRblb2 effector. Rpi-blb2 triggers HCD through NbSGT1-mediated pathways, but not NbEDS1- or NbNDR1-mediated pathways. In addition, the role of salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) in Rpi-blb2-mediated HCD were analyzed by monitoring of the responses of NbICS1-, NbCOI1-, or NbEIN2-silenced or Rpi-blb2::NahG-transgenic plants. Rpi-blb2-mediated HCD in response to AVRblb2 was not associated with SA accumulation. Thus, SA affects Rpi-blb2-mediated resistance against P. infestans, but not Rpi-blb2-mediated HCD in response to AVRblb2. Additionally, JA and ET signaling were not required for Rpi-blb2-mediated HCD in N. benthamiana. Taken together, these findings suggest that NbSGT1 is a unique positive regulator of Rpi-blb2-mediated HCD in response to AVRblb2, but EDS1, NDR1, SA, JA, and ET are not required.

AB BACKGROUND: Recently, clinical trials revealed renal impairment induced by hydroxyethyl starch (HES) in septic patients. In prior studies, we managed to demonstrate that HES accumulated in renal proximal tubule cells (PTCs). The related pathomechanism has not yet been discovered. To validate our hypothesis that the HES molecule itself is harmful, regardless of its molecule size or origin, we conducted a comprehensive study to elucidate the influences of. different HES preparations on PTC viability in vitro.
   METHODS: Cell viability of human PTC was measured with a cytotoxicity assay, quantifying the reduction of tetrazolium salt to colored formazan. Experiments were performed by assessing the influence of different carrier solutions of HES (balanced, nonbalanced, culture medium), different average molecular weights (70, 130, 200 kDa), different origins (potato or corn derived), and various durations of incubation (2-21 hours). Furthermore, HES 130/0.4 was fractionated by ultrafiltration, and the impact on cell viability of average single-size fractions with <3, 3 to 10, 10 to 30, 30 to 50, 50 to 100, and >100 kDa was investigated. We also tested the possible synergistic effects of inflammation induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
   RESULTS: All tested HES solutions, regardless of origin or carrier matrix, decreased cell viability in an equivalent, dose-dependent manner. Coincubation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha did not reduce HES-induced reduction of cell viability. Minor differences were detected comparing 70, 130, and 200 kDa preparations. Analysis of fractionated HES revealed that each fraction decreased cell viability. Even small HES molecules (10-30 kDa) were significantly deleterious.
   CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we were able to show that only the total mass of HES molecules applied is responsible for the harmful impact on renal PTC in vitro. Neither molecular size nor their origin showed any relevance.

AB Two types of hairpin RNA (hpRNA) constructions were designed using a chimeric gene formed from two genes, the coat protein (CP) gene or the silencing suppressor gene, from the Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and the Potato virus Y (PVYN), respectively; one type generated a single hairpin structure, whereas the other formed a two-hairpin structure. Four constructs, pDCPSH (double CP gene fragments, single hairpin), pDCPDH (double CP gene fragments, double hairpins), pHC2bSH (two silencing suppressor gene fragments, single hairpin), and pHC2bDH (two silencing suppressor gene fragments, double hairpins), were individually introduced into tobacco plants. A transcript analysis demonstrates that the small interference RNA (siRNA) processing efficiency was greater with the double-hairpin construct than with the single-hairpin construct, although the expression of their target genes were similar. A viral resistance assay shows that the transgenic tobacco plants effectively resisted a mixed infection of CMV and Potato virus Y (PVYN) and that pDCPDH exhibited the highest silencing efficiency. The accumulation of siRNA in the inoculated transgenic plants expressing different hairpin structures was similar. A genetic analysis reveals that viral resistance in the transgenic plants was stably inherited from the T-0 to T-1 generation. A transcript analysis and a viral resistance assay indicate that the double-hairpin structure of the same target sequences tended to produce more siRNA before the virus inoculation and thus strengthened RNA-mediated viral resistance.

AB In many semiarid areas of China, potato production is often limited by poor soil fertility and low fertilizer use efficiency, but topdressing to deeper soil layers in the late growing period is difficult. With the aim of improving fertilizer use efficiency and minimizing negative impacts on the environment, a new palygorskite-coated slow-release fertilizer was prepared. According to the nutrient requirements of potato in its three main growth stages, the product consisted of three parts of chemical fertilizers with each part coated by palygorskite. A two-year study was undertaken to investigate the controlled release behavior of the product, and its impact on potato yield and fertilizer uptake was also evaluated. Two coating ratios (20 and 30%) of palygorskite-coated vs. palygorskite-mixed chemical fertilizer and chemical fertilizers only were applied with three rates (all kg ha(-1)): (1) low (94.5 N and 4.5 P), (2) medium (137.9 N, 16.5 P and 10.5 K), and (3) high (223.4 N, 24.0 P and 81.0 K). The results both from soil (mineral N and available P) and crop (leaf nitrate N) indicated a controlled release characteristic of palygorskite-coated fertilizer which synchronized better with nutrient demands of potato plants. The palygorskite-coated fertilizer treatment resulted in the highest total tuber yield, 14.6-20.3% higher than the control. Partial factor productivity of N, P and K fertilizer was also significantly increased by palygorskite-coated fertilizer. The palygorskite-coated fertilizer could be promising for potato production and be beneficial to agricultural sustainability in semiarid areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To evaluate the effects of mulching and ridge and furrow widths on soil temperature and moisture, crop growth and yield, and water use efficiency (WUE), a series of field experiments were conducted in a potato field in Inner Mongolia, China. In 2009 and 2010, four treatments (flat plot without mulching (CK), plastic film mulched ridge (MR), MRF (plastic film mulched ridge and furrow (MRF), and non-mulched (NM0.5)) were conducted on the same widths of ridge (0.5 m) and furrow (0.5 m), and two additional non-mulching treatments (1.0 m ridge and furrow width (NM1.0), and 1.5 m ridge and furrow width (NM1.5)) were tested in 2011 and 2012. The results indicated that mulching practices increased topsoil temperature compared to non-mulching treatments at the emergence stage. Compared to CK, the soil water storage in furrows was increased by 10.2 mm on average in 2009 for the MRF treatment, 8.1 mm and 15.1 mm in 2011, and 14.0 mm and 21.2 mm in 2012 for NM1.0 and NM1.5, respectively, and plant leaf area index and dry biomass values during the potato growth stage were also increased. The MR treatment produced greater effects on crop productivity than NM0.5, and increased total yield and marketable yield by 21.4% and 36.3% compared to CK in 2010. Of three non-mulching treatments (i.e., NM0.5, NM1.0, and NM1.5), the NM1.0 treatment produced the highest total yield and marketable yield; compared to CK, the WUE, total yield, and marketable yield were increased by 12.7%, 8.2%, and 52.0% in 2011, and 23.4%, 16.4%, and 81.0% in 2012, respectively.

AB Many crop models have been developed for potato, and a few for sweet potato, and yam. More than 30 potato models, two sweet potato models, and three yam models are described in the literature, and each differ in model structure. Some potato models have been applied to studies of nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation management, and climate change impact, but most of these models have never been validated with field measurements. The nitrogen dynamics of potato models CROPSYSTVB-CSPOTATO, EXpert-N-SPASS, and LINTUL-NPOTATO have been tested with some field data. LPOTCO and AQUACROP are two potato models that have been tested under elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions. None of the models have ever been tested with high temperature or heat stress data. The most tested and applied potato models include versions of LINTUL and SUBSTOR-Potato. Two sweet potato models, MADHURAM and SPOTCOMS, and two yam models, CROPSYSTVB-Yam and EPIC-Yam had limited field-testing under current climate conditions; however, these sweet potato and yam models are not ready for climate change impact assessments. To prepare potato, sweet potato, and yam models for climate change impact assessments, they need to be (i) calibrated with modern cultivars across agro-climatic zones; (ii) tested and improved with crop physiology and dynamic measurements of phenology, growth, partitioning, and water and nitrogen uptake under different crop management and environments; and (iii) tested and improved with field studies of crop responses to climate factors, including elevated CO2, water stress, increased temperature, heat stress, and combinations of these. Such extensive model testing and improvement with field experiments require a coordinated international effort and long-term commitment to potato, sweet potato, and yam research.

SO GUT
LA English
DT Article
ID COLONIC DIVERTICULOSIS; RISK; CANCER; CEREAL; MEN
AB Background Previous prospective studies have found the incidence of intestinal diverticular disease decreased with increasing intakes of dietary fibre, but associations by the fibre source are less well characterised. We assessed these associations in a large UK prospective study of middle-aged women.
   Methods and findings During 6 (SD 1) years follow-up of 690 075 women without known diverticular disease who had not changed their diet in the last 5 years, 17 325 were admitted to hospital or died with diverticular disease. Dietary fibre intake was assessed using a validated 40-item food questionnaire and remeasured 1 year later in 4265 randomly-selected women. Mean total dietary fibre intake at baseline was 13.8 (SD 5.0) g/day, of which 42% came from cereals, 22% from fruits, 19% from vegetables (not potatoes) and 15% from potatoes. The relative risk (95% CI) for diverticular disease per 5 g/day fibre intake was 0.86 (0.84 to 0.88). There was significant heterogeneity by the four main sources of fibre (p<0.0001), with relative risks, adjusted for each of the other sources of dietary fibre of 0.84 (0.81 to 0.88) per 5 g/day for cereal, 0.81 (0.77 to 0.86) per 5 g/day for fruit, 1.03 (0.93 to 1.14) per 5 g/day for vegetable and 1.04 (1.02 to 1.07) per 1 g/day for potato fibre.
   Conclusions A higher intake of dietary fibre is associated with a reduced risk of diverticular disease. The associations with diverticular disease appear to vary by fibre source, and the reasons for this variation are unclear.

LA English
DT Article
DE Hyperkalemia; potassium-restricted diet; potassium exchange resin; renal
   insufficiency; soaking
ID CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; PRETREATMENT; PREVALENCE; KAYEXALATE; FORMULA
AB In this study, we determined, by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, the potassium amount leached by soaking or boiling foods identified by children suffering from chronic renal failure as "pleasure food'' and that they cannot eat because of their low-potassium diet, and evaluated whether addition of sodium polystyrene sulfonate resin (i.e. Kayexalate (R)) during soaking or boiling modulated potassium loss. A significant amount of potassium content was removed by soaking (16% for chocolate and potato, 26% for apple, 37% for tomato and 41% for banana) or boiling in a large amount of water (73% for potato). Although Kayexalate (R) efficiently dose-dependently removed potassium from drinks (by 48% to 73%), resin addition during soaking or boiling did not eliminate more potassium from solid foods. Our results therefore provide useful information for dietitians who elaborate menus for people on potassium-restricted diets and would give an interesting alternative to the systematic elimination of all potassium-rich foods from their diet.

   POPULATIONS; SUSCEPTIBILITY
AB The Colorado potato beetle (CPB, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say), is a major pest of potatoes in Iran and many other parts of the world. Injury is caused when adults and larvae feed on the foliage and stems of potato plants, resulting in poor yields and/or plant death. Adult beetles can also vector plant diseases. Historically, the CPB been controlled using different insecticides, but it is currently resistant to nearly all classes of insecticides and remains a serious pest in many parts of the world. All of the resistance mechanisms reported in insects have been demonstrated in CPB. L. decemlineata invaded Iran in the early 1980s, probably through the importation of infested potatoes. It has caused significant damage to potato crops in affected areas, and it accordingly remains a major threat to Iranian potato production. Regrettably, no IPM programs have been developed for managing CPB infestations in Iran. Furthermore, there are no organized CPB resistance monitoring programs in Iran, and the recommended insecticides for CPB control, endosulfan and phosalon, have not changed in over 22 years. Anecdotal evidence from local farmers suggests a reduction in the efficacy of control of CPB by commonly used insecticides, probably due to the reduced susceptibility to these insecticides. Given the economic significance of L. decemlineata infestations, the increasing prevalence of resistance in this species, the rate of spread of infestations, and the extent of the area infested, there is an urgent need to develop effective and sustainable integrated pest management programs for CPB in Iran.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular identification and virulence of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. Initially, the alignments of nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1-5.8S-ITS4 regions of six isolates-TFFH1, TFFH3, PR1, MAP, GT(3), and GT(2)-were investigated using GenBank ITS sequences for the same region and species of fungus. Thereafter, the in vitro (germination, vegetative growth, and sporulation) and the in vivo (%mortality of Bemisia tabaci) virulence of the fungus were investigated. A BLAST search of the ITS1 region revealed a match to a sequence registered under the accession number for M. anisopliae. The submitted sequence data were registered and provided with the accession numbers JX041507 to JX0415012, which were released in August 2012 (GenBank). In the virulence experiments, the highest germination percentage, vegetative growth, and sporulation of M. anisopliae were observed in the isolate PRI, with mean values of 97.2%, 4.6 cm, and 7.2 x 10(6) conidia/ml, respectively; while the highest mortality percentage of B. tabaci was observed in the isolate GT(3), with an mean value of 84.3%. This study concludes that all the six tested isolates-TFFH1 TFFH3, PR1, MAP, GT(3), and GT(2)-are M. anisopliae and the isolates PR1 and GT(3) are more virulent to B. tabaci than that by the other four isolates.

AB The pea leafminer fly, Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard), was found infesting and damaging Korean potato crops during a 2012 field survey. Localized outbreaks of L. huidobrensis were observed in Miryang and Goiyeong counties in the south of the Korean Peninsula. This paper describes the morphological and genetic characteristics of the Korean population of L huidobrensis. The dorsal color pattern on the abdomen, and an array of microsetae on the thorax, were the main diagnostic characteristics of this species. On the basis of an analysis of a partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) DNA sequence, we found that intraspecific variation in L huidobrensis was negligible, and that the distance between L huidobrensis and a closely related species, L. trifolii, was estimated to be 7.4-7.6 K2P. This is the first report of the infestation of field crops by the invasive leafminer L. huidobrensis in Korea.

AB In the present study, 95 isolates of bacteria were tested for their biosurfactant as well as biocontrol activity against Phytophthora infestans. The results revealed that only 15.8% isolates showed biosurfactant activity. The emulsification index ranged from 0-68% and 24.2% isolates showed positive reaction for biosurfactant properties. In emulsification assay and oil spreading test, 18.95% and 5.26% isolates, respectively scored positive for biosurfactant production. Among all, only five isolates were found effective against P infestans, for biocontrol properties. Pseudomonas aeruginosa-1 showed 62.22% inhibition zone after 72 hrs while P aeruginosa-3 showed 46.42%. Forty-eight hrs old culture supernatants were highly effective in food-poisoning test, tuber slice test and detached leaf method against P infestans. In whole potato plant test, bacterial cell based formulation, culture supernatant and bacterial cell suspension of P aeruginosa-1 showed 10.42%, 9.94% and 17.96% diseases severity respectively, as against 53.96% in control. This isolate holds promise as biological control agent against P infestans in field.

AB Phenylamide fungicides have been widely used for the control of oomycete-incited plant diseases for over 30 years. Insensitivity to this chemical class of fungicide was recorded early in its usage history, but the precise protein(s) conditioning insensitivity has proven difficult to determine. To determine the genetic basis of insensitivity and to inform strategies for the cloning of the gene(s) responsible, genetic crosses were established between Mefenoxam sensitive and intermediate insensitive isolates of Phytophthora infestans, the potato late blight pathogen. F1 progeny showed the expected semi-dominant phenotypes for Mefenoxam insensitivity and suggested the involvement of multiple loci, complicating the positional cloning of the gene(s) conditioning insensitivity to Mefenoxam. Instead, a candidate gene strategy was used, based on previous observations that the primary effect of phenylamide compounds is to inhibit ribosomal RNA synthesis. The subunits of RNA polymerase I (RNApolI) were sequenced from sensitive and insensitive isolates and F1 progeny. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) specific to insensitive field isolates were identified in the gene encoding the large subunit of RNApolI. In a survey of field isolates, SNP T1145A (Y382F) showed an 86% association with Mefenoxam insensitivity. Isolates not showing this association belonged predominantly to one P. infestans genotype. The transfer of the 'insensitive' allele of RPA190 to a sensitive isolate yielded transgenic lines that were insensitive to Mefenoxam. These results demonstrate that sequence variation in RPA190 contributes to insensitivity to Mefenoxam in P. infestans.

AB Objective: Family functioning, which reflects how well family members communicate and interact with each other, is associated with childhood overweight and obesity, but its association with children's eating behaviors remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the association between family functioning and unhealthy food and beverage consumption among children ages 1 to 12 y old.
   Methods: As part of the Victorian Child Health and Wellbeing study, a random sample of 4602 caregivers of children completed an interview during a single telephone interview in 2006. Caregivers reported on their child's consumption of three types of unhealthy foods and beverages, and responses were recoded into weekly consumption of potato crisps and chips, monthly consumption of takeaway foods, and daily consumption of sweet beverages. Family functioning included general functioning (alpha = 0.89) and parental psychological distress (alpha = 0.78).
   Results: Consumption of potato crisps and chips occurred, on average, twice a week, while takeaway foods were consumed an average of three times per month. Consistently and controlling for other covariates, male caregivers had children who consumed takeaway foods more frequently and who drank more daily cups of sweet beverages. Caregiver education and living in a single-parent household were consistently associated with poorer eating habits. In all models, general family functioning and parental psychological distress were associated with poorer eating habits.
   Conclusions: In addition to traditional methods for improving diet, family-based interventions need to target more general aspects of the family's and caregiver's functioning to improve dietary intake. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Photoperiodic phenological adaptations are prevalent in many organisms living in seasonal environments. As both photoperiod and growth season length change with latitude, species undergoing latitudinal range expansion often need to synchronize their life cycle with a changing photoperiod and growth season length. Since adaptive synchronization often involves a large number of time-consuming genetic changes, behavioural plasticity might be a faster way to adjust to novel conditions. We compared behavioural and physiological traits in overwintering (diapause) preparation in three latitudinally different European Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) populations reared under two photoperiods. Our aim was to study whether behavioural plasticity could play a role in rapid range expansion into seasonal environments. Our results show that while burrowing into the soil occurred in the southernmost studied population also under a non-diapause-inducing long photoperiod, the storage lipid content of these beetles was very low compared to the northern populations. However, similar behavioural plasticity was not found in the northern populations. Furthermore, the strongest suppression of energy metabolism was seen in pre-diapause beetles from the northernmost population. These results could indicate accelerated diapause preparation and possibly energetic adjustments due to temporal constraints imposed by a shorter, northern, growth season. Our results indicate that behavioural plasticity in burrowing may have facilitated initial range expansion of L. decemlineata in Europe. However, long-term persistence at high latitudes has required synchronization of burrowing behaviour with physiological traits. The results underline that eco-physiological life-history traits of insects, such as diapause, should be included in studies on range expansion.

AB The composition of the essential oil of Zanthoxylum bungeanum was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 35 components, which constitute 99.10% of the oil, were identified. The major constituent was alpha-pinene (19.59%). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the essential oil and alpha-pinene against Fusarium sulphureum were determined to be 6.25% and 12.50%, respectively. A determination of the antifungal activity and inhibitory effect of the essential oil and alpha-pinene showed that the essential oil more significantly decreased cell membrane integrity and inhibited spore germination than alpha-pinene. Observations using scaning electron microscope revealed morphological modification including mycelium asymmetry, hyphal swelling, curling, and a secretory appearance. Ultrastructural alterations were also observed including cell empty cavity and osmiophilic granule generation. In vivo testing showed that the oil and alpha-pinene effectively controlled dry rot of potato inoculated with F. sulphureum. These findings indicated that the oil and alpha-pinene directly inhibit fungal growth, and the essential oil showed pronounced potential than alpha-pinene.

AB Streptomyces scabies is a causal agent of common scab of potato, which generates necrotic tuber lesions. We have previously demonstrated that inoculation of potato plants with phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA)-producing Pseudomonas sp. LBUM223 could significantly reduce common scab symptoms. In the present study, we investigated whether LBUM223 or an isogenic phzC- mutant not producing PCA could elicit an induced systemic resistance response in potato. The expression of eight defense-related genes (salicylic acid [SA]-related ChtA, PR-lb, PR-2, and PR-5; and jasnionic acid and ethylene-related LOX, PIN2, PAL-2, and ERF3) was quantified using newly developed TaqMan reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays in 5- and 10-week-old potted potato plants. Although only wild-type LBUM223 was capable of significantly reducing common scab symptoms, the presence of both LBUM223 and its PCA-deficient mutant were equally able to upregulate the expression of LOX and PR-5. The presence of S. scabies overexpressed all SA-related genes. This indicates that (i) upregulation of potato defense-related genes by LBUM223 is unlikely to contribute to common scab's control and (ii) LBUM223's capacity to produce PCA is not involved in this upregulation. These results suggest that a direct interaction occurring between S. scabies and PCA-producing LBUM223 is more likely involved in controlling common scab development.

AB Embryo infection is important for efficient seed transmission of viroids. To identify the major pattern of seed transmission of viroids, we used in situ hybridization to histochemically analyze the distribution of Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) in each developmental stage of petunia (flowering to mature seed stages). In floral organs, PSTVd was present in the reproductive tissues of infected female x infected male and infected female x healthy male but not of healthy female x infected male before embryogenesis. After pollination, PSTVd was detected in the developed embryo and endosperm in all three crosses. These findings indicate that PSTVd is indirectly delivered to the embryo through ovule or pollen during the development of reproductive tissues before embryogenesis but not directly through maternal tissues as cell-to-cell movement during embryogenesis.

AB The dicarboximide fungicide dimethachlon has been widely used for controlling Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in China for more than a decade. To assess the current status of dimethachlon resistance in S. sclerotiorum in China, 2,424 isolates were collected from disease-infected oilseed rape and soybean plants in five provinces of China in 2011 and 2012, and dimethachlon resistance was monitored by mycelial growth inhibition method on potato dextrose agar (PDA) media. Dimethachlon at 5 mu g/ml was used as a discriminatory dose to detect resistance in all isolates, and 50% effective concentration values were determined for all dimethachlon-resistant isolates and some sensitive isolates. No dimethachlon resistance was detected in isolates from Anhui province (eastern China), Gansu province (northwestern China), and Qinghai province (western China). In Hunan province (central China), 3 of 268 (1.12%) isolates collected from oilseed rape plants in 2012 were resistant to dimethachlon, and the resistance ratios for the three resistant isolates were 4.56, 32.70, and 105.53, respectively. In Heilongjiang province (northeastern China), 8 of 243 (3.29%) isolates collected from soybean plants in 2011 were resistant to dimethachlon, with resistance ratios of 5.57 to 94.80; 11 of 409 (2.69%) isolates collected in 2012 were resistant to dimethachlon, with resistance ratios of 3.21 to 9.69. Cross-resistance studies showed that there was positive cross-resistance between dimethachlon and iprodione, procymidone, and the N-phenyl carbamate fungicide diethofencarb. No cross-resistance was found between dimethachlon and carbendazim, tebuconazole, kresoxim-methyl, thiram, and boscalid. Compared with the sensitive isolates of S. sclerotiorum, the field-dimethachlon-resistant isolates were more sensitive to osmotic pressure, grew more slowly on PDA media, and were less pathogenic on leaves of oilseed rape.

AB A fast and simple polymerase chain reaction method has been developed for detection of Phytophthora infestans oospores, the causal agent of Late blight of Potato in soil. The method involves the disruption of oospores by grinding dry soil, using abrasive properties, in the presence of glass powder and skimmed milk powder within a short time. The latter prevents loss of DNA by adsorption to soil particles or by degradation and reduces the co-extraction of PCR inhibitors with the DNA. After phenol/chloroform extraction; the DNA is suitable for direct PCR amplification without a precipitation step. This amplification leads to detection of pathogen in infested soils before planting of crop. The real-time PCR assay we describe is highly sensitive and specific, and has several advantages over conventional PCR assays used for P. infestans detection to confirm positive inoculum level in potato seeds and elsewhere. With increasing amounts of standard DNA templates, the respective threshold cycle (Ct) values were determined and a linear relationship was established between these Ct values and the logarithm of initial template amounts. The method is rapid, cost efficient, and when combined with suitable internal controls can be applied to the detection and quantification of P. infestans oospores on a large-scale basis.

AB Intensive vegetable production is constantly facing the emergence of new viral diseases. Apart from the intrinsic features of viruses as plant pathogens, the highly dynamic turnover of cultivars and cultural practices, and the global trade of seeds and products characteristic of intensive vegetable production may favour the emergence of new viruses, as well as the expansion of the geographical range of vectors responsible for their dissemination. Indeed, the efficient transmission of viruses plays a major role in the impact and outcome of viral epidemics. Whiteflies (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) that belong to the genera Bemisia and Trialeurodes are efficient virus vectors. Whiteflies transmit viruses of at least four genera, one of DNA viruses, the genus Begomovirus, and three of RNA viruses, Crinivirus, Ipomovirus and Torradovirus. Begomoviruses have been the subject of recent reviews. In this article we review the genome structure, epidemiology and control of whitefly-transmitted RNA viruses that belong to the genera Crinivirus, Ipomovirus and Torradovirus, with an extended discussion on the particular viruses within these genera that are currently causing important outbreaks, such are Cucumber vein yellowing virus (CVYV), Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV), Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) and Tomato torrado virus (ToTV).

AB Candidatus Liberibacter species are Gram-negative bacteria that live as phloem-limited obligate parasites in plants, and are associated with several plant diseases. These bacteria are transmitted by insects called psyllids, or jumping plant lice, which feed on plant phloem sap. Citrus huanglongbing (yellow shoot) or citrus greening disease is associated with three different species of Ca. Liberibacter - Ca. L. asiaticus, Ca. L. africanus and Ca. L. americanus - all originally found on different continents. Ca. L. asiaticus is the most severe pathogen, spread by Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri and causing devastating epidemics in several countries. Ca. L. africanus occurs in Africa where it is spread by the African citrus psyllid Trioza erytreae. Ca. Liberibacter solanacearum is associated with diseases in several solanaceous plants, and transmitted by potato psyllid Bactericera cockerelli. Zebra chip disease is causing large damage in potato crops in North America. In Europe Ca. Liberibacter solanacearum is associated with diseases of the Apiaceae family of plants, carrot and celery, and transmitted by psyllids Trioza apicalis and Bactericera trigonica. When Ca. Liberibacter is suspected as the disease agent, the diagnosis is confirmed by DNA-based detection methods. Ca. Liberibacter-associated plant diseases can be controlled by using healthy plant propagation material, eradicating symptomatic plants, and by controlling the psyllid populations spreading the disease.

AB Applications of the synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to the foliage of potato plants can reduce common scab, a tuber disease. However, in prior research effective applications at 200 mg L-1 2,4-D resulted in phytotoxic side effects with reduced tuber yield and quality. This study showed that minimal significant threshold rates from 8.3 to 23.6 mg L-1 2,4-D reduced disease incidence in pot trials, and from 10.8 to 41.0 mg L-1 minimised disease severity in both pot and field trials. In only one pot trial, significant phytotoxicity was found with rates of 100 mg L-1 or greater, reducing mean total tuber mass per plot and 38 mg L-1 or greater, reducing mean mass per tuber. Notably, within the field trial, a more reliable plant growth system for estimation of yield, no significant impacts were observed. Disease control was associated with decreased sensitivity of tubers to thaxtomin A, the phytotoxin produced by the common scab pathogen essential for disease induction. The amount of residual 2,4-D in tubers at harvest varied with cultivar, Russet Burbank accumulating more 2,4-D than Desiree. Application rates less than 100 mg L-1 resulted in levels of 2,4-D below the Australian standard maximum residue limit. These data suggest that applications of 2,4-D at low rates could provide a commercially suitable control strategy for common scab.

AB Plants synthesize a broad range of secondary metabolites that act as natural defenses against plant pathogens and herbivores. Among these, potato plants produce glycoalkaloids (GAs). In this study, we analyzed the effects of the dried extract of fresh potato leaves (EPL) on the biological parameters of the lepidopteran, Galleria mellonella (L.) and compared its activity to one of the main EPL components, the GA alpha-solanine. Wax moth larvae were reared from first instar on a diet supplemented with three concentrations of EPL or alpha-solanine. Both EPL and alpha-solanine affected survivorship, fecundity, and fertility of G. mellonella to approximately the same extent. We evaluated the effect of EPL and alpha-solanine on oxidative stress in midgut and fat body by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCO) contents, both biomarkers of oxidative damage. We evaluated glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, a detoxifying enzyme acting in prevention of oxidative damage. EPL and alpha-solanine altered MDA and PCO concentrations and GST activity in fat body and midgut. We infer that the influence of EPL on G. mellonella is not enhanced by synergistic effects of the totality of potato leaf components compared to alpha-solanine alone. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB order to improve the biotransformation rate of Spartina alterniflora (SA) and evaluate the feasibility of NaOH-treatment as a pretreatment of digested SA (DSA) for advanced anaerobic biogasification, two experiments were conducted under lab-scale conditions. First, SA was directly digested under 35 +/- 1 degrees C with initial total solid (TS) loading of 20% (the first stage). After 90 day's reaction, cumulative biogas yield of SA and average methane content were 388 22 ml g(-1) TSadded and 59.62 +/- 1.88%, respectively. Then the DSA was treated with 5% NaOH solution and was used for advanced biogasification (the second stage). The cumulative biogas yield of NaOH-treatment and control were 210 +/- 11 ml g(-1) TSadded and 103 +/- 16 ml g(-1) TSadded, respectively, with 70.78 +/- 2.11% and 76.92 +/- 1.94% of average methane content. The total cumulative biogas yield (sum of the first stage and the second stage of NaOH-treatment) and TS removal rate of SA were 495 24 ml g(-1) TSadded and 76.85 +/- 1.94%. After NaOH treatment, surface lignin and some carbohydrate of DSA were destructed into lignin fragment, organic acids, and some other small molecular organic matter; while the skeleton structure of lignin and cellulose were not destructed significantly. The results of C-13 NMR showed that methyl and carboxylic C groups of DSA were decomposed significantly. The results indicated that NaOH-treatment was a good pretreatment for DSA.

AB Effects of extrusion and drum-drying treatments on physico-functional and antioxidant properties of flours prepared from purple-flesh sweet potato were evaluated. Extrusion variables were feed moisture contents (MC; 10%, 13%, 16%) and screw speeds (SS; 250, 325, 400 r.p.m.), whereas drum-drying was done at 120, 130 or 140 degrees C. Effects of MC were generally greater than SS on flour properties. Extruded flours showed higher water absorption and water solubility indices compared with control nonextruded flours. Regardless of SS, total phenolic content and antioxidant activities (DPPH and ABTS) of flours processed at 10% MC were significantly higher than those at 13% and 16%. Both extruded and drum-dried flours exhibited no peak viscosity, indicating complete gelatinisation of starch. Maximum phenolic content and antioxidant activities of drum-dried flours were obtained at 140 degrees C. Although drum-dried flours had higher antioxidant capacity than extruded flours, both flours could potentially be used as food ingredients.

The experiments were conducted using a central composite design to determine the visual appearance and initial moisture content (30-50%) of the mushroom caps. The initial moisture content and microwave power intensity showed highly significant linear relations with the expansion ratio and sensory evaluation. The optimal conditions for puffing mushroom caps were initial moisture content, microwave intensity, vacuum pressure and pulse ratio of 35%, 40 W g(-1), 77.5 +/- 1.5 kPa and 1.35, which resulted in an optimal expansion ratio and sensory score of 163.2% and 6.83, respectively. The caps puffed using PMVP showed better textures, sensory scores and microstructures than those puffed using either MP or MVP.

AB Background: The aim of the study was to investigate prospective associations between dietary patterns and cognitive performance during adolescence. Methods: Participants were sourced from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study that includes 2868 children born between 1989 and 1992 in Perth, Western Australia. When the children were 17 years old (2006-2009), cognitive performance was assessed using a computerized cognitive battery of tests (CogState) that included six tasks. Using a food frequency questionnaire administered when the children were 14 years old (2003-2006), 'Healthy' and 'Western' dietary patterns were identified by factor analysis. Associations between dietary patterns at 14 years of age and cognitive performance at 17 years of age were assessed prospectively using multivariate regression models. Results: Dietary and cognitive performance data were available for 602 participants. Following adjustment for the 'Healthy' dietary pattern, total energy intake, maternal education, family income, father's presence in the family, family functioning and gender, we found that a longer reaction time in the detection task (beta=.016; 95% CI: 0.004; 0.028; p=.009) and a higher number of total errors in the Groton Maze Learning Test - delayed recall task (beta =.060; 95% CI: 0.006; 0.114; p=.029) were significantly associated with higher scores on the 'Western' dietary pattern. The 'Western' dietary pattern was characterized by high intakes of take-away food, red and processed meat, soft drink, fried and refined food. We also found that within the dietary patterns, high intake of fried potato, crisps and red meat had negative associations, while increased fruit and leafy green vegetable intake had positive associations with some aspects of cognitive performance. Conclusion: Higher dietary intake of the 'Western' dietary pattern at age 14 is associated with diminished cognitive performance 3 years later, at 17 years.

AB Multi-auto-transformation vector system has been one of the strategies to produce marker-free transgenic plants without using selective chemicals and plant growth regulators and thus facilitating transgene stacking. In the study reported here, retransformation was carried out in marker-free transgenic potato CV. May Queen containing ChiC gene (isolated from Streptomyces griseus strain HUT 6037) with wasabi defensin (WD) gene (isolated from Wasabia japonica) to pyramid the two disease resistant genes. Molecular analyses of the developed shoots confirmed the existence of both the genes of interest (ChiC and WD) in transgenic plants. Co-expression of the genes was confirmed by RT-PCR, northern blot, and western blot analyses. Disease resistance assay of in vitro plants showed that the transgenic lines co-expressing both the ChiC and WD genes had higher resistance against the fungal pathogens, Fusarium oxysporum (Fusarium wilt) and Alternaria solani (early blight) compared to the non-transformed control and the transgenic lines expressing either of the ChiC or WD genes. The disease resistance potential of the transgenic plants could be increased by transgene stacking or multiple transformations.

AB Nitrogen fertilizers are a major source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from arable soils. The relationship between nitrogen application rates and N2O emissions was evaluated during the growth period of winter wheat (similar to 140 days) at six field sites in north-western Germany. Nitrogen was applied as calcium-ammonium-nitrate, with application rates ranging between 0 and 400 kg N ha(-1). One trial was conducted in 2010, three trials in 2011 and two trials in 2012. Additionally, post-harvest N2O emissions were evaluated at two field sites during autumn and winter (2012-2013). The emission factors (during the growth period) varied between 0.10 and 0.37 %. Annual N2O emissions ranged between 0.46 and 0.53 % and were consistently lower across all sites and years than to the IPCC Tier 1 default value (1.0 %). Across all sites and years, the relationship between N2O and N application rate was best described by linear regression even if nitrogen amounts applied were higher than the nitrogen uptake of the crop. Additionally, annual N2O emissions per unit of harvested wheat grain were calculated for two field sites to assess the environmental impact of wheat grain production. Yield-scaled N2O emissions followed a hyperbolic function with a minimum of 177 and 191 g N2O-N t grain yield(-1) at application rates of 127 and 150 kg N ha(-1), followed by an increase at higher N application rates. This relationship indicates that wheat crop fertilization does not necessarily harm the environment through N2O emissions compared to zero fertilization. Thus, improving nitrogen use efficiency may be the best management practice for mitigating yield-scaled N2O emissions.

AB Fertilization with biogas residues from the digestion of energy crops is of growing importance. Digestate from silage maize (Zea mays L.) is a new fertilizer with a high potential for ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different maize fertilization systems [180 kg N ha(-1) in form of calcium nitrate (MIN), biogas digestate from maize (DIG) and biogas digestate from maize mixed with the nitrification inhibitor Piadin (DIG + NI)] on the emission of NH3 and N2O from a sandy soil and to assess the total greenhouse gas emission of these fertilization systems. The study is based on a randomized field plot experiment in central Germany and an experimental period of a full year. Annual N2O-N emission was generally low [0.21 (MIN) to 0.37 (DIG) kg N ha(-1)] without differences between treatments. The application of Piadin reduced N2O emissions by 37 and 62 % during the weeks following digestate application but the annual N2O emission was not affected by the fertilization treatment. NH3 emission was only significant for treatments fertilized with digestate. It was not affected by Piadin and accounted for 27 % (+NI) and 29 % of the applied ammonium. Total greenhouse gas emission was dominated by NH3 losses (reducing the fertilizer value and inducing indirect N2O emissions) for the treatments fertilized with maize digestate. The most important greenhouse gas emission source of the MIN treatment were emissions from fertilizer production. Our results show the high potential of digestate from maize as a new source of NH3 emission. Mitigation measures are essential to save the value of this new fertilizer type and to reduce atmospheric and environmental pollution by direct emission of NH3 and indirect emission of greenhouse gases.

AB Increasing methionine in potato tubers is desirable, both to increase the availability of this limiting essential amino acid and to enhance the aroma of baked and fried potatoes. Previous attempts to elevate potato methionine content using transgenic approaches have focused on increasing methionine biosynthesis. Higher isoleucine accumulation in these transgenic tubers suggested that the potatoes compensate for increased methionine biosynthesis with enhanced catabolism via methionine gamma-lyase (MGL), thereby producing 2-ketybutyrate for isoleucine biosynthesis. In the current study, we show that potato StMGL1 encodes a functional MGL in potato tubers. In planta silencing of StMGL1 results in an increased methionine to isoleucine ratio in the free amino acid profile of potato tubers and, in some transgenic lines, elevated accumulation of free methionine. In both wild-type and transgenic tubers, the ratio of methionine to isoleucine is negatively correlated with the level of StMGL1 transcript. A three-dimensional distribution of free amino acids in potato tubers is also described.

AB Potato cold-induced sweetening (CIS) is critical for the postharvest quality of potato tubers. Starch degradation is considered to be one of the key pathways in the CIS process. However, the functions of the genes that encode enzymes related to starch degradation in CIS and the activity regulation of these enzymes have received less attention. A potato amylase inhibitor gene known as SbAI was cloned from the wild potato species Solanum berthaultii. This genetic transformation confirmed that in contrast to the SbAI suppression in CIS-resistant potatoes, overexpressing SbAI in CIS-sensitive potatoes resulted in less amylase activity and a lower rate of starch degradation accompanied by a lower reducing sugar (RS) content in cold-stored tubers. This finding suggested that the SbAI gene may play crucial roles in potato CIS by modulating the amylase activity. Further investigations indicated that pairwise protein-protein interactions occurred between SbAI and alpha-amylase StAmy23, beta-amylases StBAM1 and StBAM9. SbAI could inhibit the activities of both alpha-amylase and beta-amylase in potato tubers primarily by repressing StAmy23 and StBAM1, respectively. These findings provide the first evidence that SbAI is a key regulator of the amylases that confer starch degradation and RS accumulation in cold-stored potato tubers.

AB Meloidogyne spp., commonly known as root-knot nematodes (RKNs), are economically important plant sedentary endoparasites that cause galls on susceptible hosts. The Columbia root-knot nematode (CRKN), M. chitwoodi, is a quarantine A2 type pest by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization since 1998. This nematode has been found associated with economically important crops such as potato and tomato, causing severe damage and making the agricultural products unacceptable for the fresh market and food processing. In vitro co-culture of host and parasite offers an advantageous experimental system for studying plant-RKN interactions. The structure, growth and production of volatiles of Solanum tuberosum hairy roots (HR) and of S. tuberosum HR/CRKN co-cultures were compared. HR were induced by inoculation of aseptic potato tuber segments with Rhizobium rhizogenes. Co-cultures were initiated by inoculating HR with sterilized CRKN eggs. Infection with CRKN induced the RKN symptomatology in the HR and several nematode life stages were observed by light and scanning electron microscopy. Potato HR and HR/CRKN co-cultures exhibited similar growth patterns, evaluated by measuring fresh and dry weight and by the dissimilation method. Volatiles, isolated by distillation-extraction and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, revealed that palmitic acid (37-52 %), n-pentadecanal (10-16 %) and linoleic acid (2-16 %) were the main constitutive components of S. tuberosum HR, and of the HR/CRKN co-cultures (24-44, 8-22 and 4-18 %, respectively). S. tuberosum HR/CRKN co-cultures can be considered a suitable biotechnological tool to study RKN infection mechanism by mimicking what occurs under field conditions.

AB Endophytic fungi represent an under explored resource of novel lead compounds and have the capacity to produce diverse classes of plant secondary metabolites. Here, we investigated the endophytic fungal diversity of taxol-producing endophytes from Taxus baccata L. ssp. wallichiana (Zucc.) Pilger and also tested the antimitogenic effect of fungal taxol using potato disc tumor assay. A total of 60 fungal endophytes were isolated from the inner bark (phloem-cambium) of T. baccata ssp. wallichiana, collected from different locations of the northern Himalayan region. Two key genes, DBAT (10-deacetylbaccatin III-10-O-acetyl transferase) and BAPT (C-13 phenylpropanoid side chain-CoA acyltransferase), involved in taxol biosynthesis were used as molecular markers for the screening of taxol-producing strains. Five representative species gave positive amplification hits by molecular marker screening with the bapt gene. These fungi were characterized and identified based on morphological and molecular identification. The taxol-producing capability of these endophytic fungi was validated by HPLC-MS. Among the five taxol-producing fungi, the highest yield of taxol was found to be 66.25 mu g/l by Fusarium redolens compared with those of the other four strains.

AB We describe here a simple technological process based on the direct fermentation of potato starch waste (PSW), an inexpensive agro-processing industrial waste, by a potential probiotic strain, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, for enhancing L-lactic acid production. To maximize bioconversion and increase cell stability, we designed and tested a novel dialysis sac-based bioreactor. Shake flask fermentation (SFF) and fed batch fermentation in the dialysis sac bioreactor were compared for L-lactic acid production efficiency. The results showed that the starch (20 g/L) in the PSW-containing medium was completely consumed within 24 h in the dialysis sac bioreactor, compared with 48 h in the SFF. The maximum lactic acid concentration (18.9 g/L) and lactic acid productivity (0.79 g/L center dot h) obtained was 1.2- and 2.4-fold higher in the bioreactor than by SFF, respectively. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation was effected at pH 5.5 and 30 A degrees C. L. lactis cells were viable for up to four cycles in the fed batch fermentation compared to only one cycle in the SFF.

AB Two strawberry nursery field trials comparing soil disinfection with different fumigants (metam sodium, dazomet, chloropicrin, chloropicrin +1,3D) and a steaming system exploiting the exothermic reaction between steam and CaO (Bioflash System (TM)) were conducted in 2010-2012 to evaluate the effect of treatments on Verticillium dahliae Kleb. inhabiting the soil, and on plant health, growth and yield of strawberry daughter plants. Chemical fumigants and the Bioflash System (TM) decreased the number of V dahliae colonies in the soil, which corresponded to reduced incidence of Verticillium wilt (efficacy about 80%). The use of chemical fumigants had a positive impact on the size of the mother plants. The surface area covered by plants grown on the treated plots was 1.1-1.7 times larger than plants grown on non-fumigated control plots. The number of runners, as well as daughter plants, produced from plants grown on plots treated with all chemical fumigants was significantly higher than in the non-fumigated control or in the plots treated with the Bioflash System (TM). The disinfection treatments significantly increased the yield of marketable daughter plants, approximately 1.5-3 times higher in comparison to plants grown on control plots. Steam disinfection with the Bioflash System (TM) was the least effective treatment in this respect. The differences in marketable plants yield among the chemical fumigants significantly affected the net marginal return and the return on investment of the crop. In this respect, the steam disinfection was economically efficient only in one season. The efficacy in controlling Verticillium wilt even with low doses of metam sodium and dazomet and their influence on yield and quality of daughter plants is confirming the feasibility of these fumigants for strawberry nursery management.

AB Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) requires abundant nitrogen (N) to perform well and has low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). We assessed phenotypic variation among 189 potato cultivars for NUE and the association between NUE and ecophysiological variables describing canopy development (CDv), under high and low N input. In 2009 and 2010, 189 cultivars were grown with N supply (soil N + fertiliser N) of 75 or 180 kg N/ha at Bant, the Netherlands. CDv was assessed weekly as the percentage of soil covered by green potato leaves (%SC). Data were analysed using a model that described CDv as a function of thermal time, based on the Beta function and estimates of cardinal temperatures. Nitrogen significantly affected model-derived, biologically relevant, curve-fit parameters for each cultivar. The t 1 (i.e., thermal time required to reach maximum soil cover (Vx)) was higher at low than at high N. Other parameters were higher at high than at low N, especially Vx and the period over which it was maintained. Nitrogen also affected tuber dry matter yield, tuber size and weight distributions, N content and N uptake but not tuber dry matter percentage. The total area under the %SC curve was highly correlated with yield in both years. Cultivars performing well under high N also performed well under low N. There was large variation in NUE component traits among cultivars; maturity type partially explained this variation. Variables of the CDv model captured this variation, N effects on light interception and its correlation with yield.

AB One approach to decrease the environmental impact of crop production and reduce costs is to optimize agronomic practices and genotypes so that nutrients are used more efficiently. In this study the effects of agronomic practices (rotations, crop protection, fertilization) on yields, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and associated parameters were studied in an experiment using two winter wheat genotypes (Cordiale and Scaro) in one season and two potato genotypes (Sarpo Mira and Sante) in two seasons. The wheat showed no varietal differences in yield and NUE; instead the fertilization regime was the main factor affecting yield and NUE with higher values observed when conventional fertilization was used. The exception was for wheat grown after three years grass/clover ley when there was no added yield benefit from conventional fertilization of the organically bred variety (Scaro). This demonstrates the potential for N fixing crops to provide sufficient N to high yielding cereals if grown for long enough prior to planting. The greatest gains in NUE were achieved by combining an N efficient genotype with conventional crop management in an organic rotation. Fertilization and genotypic variation were the main factors affecting potato tuber yield and NUE, with the late maturing Sarpo Mira displaying elevated yields and NUE compared with the early maturing Sante. The use of organic fertility sources resulted in lower NUE, but N release from organic sources may increase NUE of future crops. This highlights the need for long-term nutrient balance and modelling studies to assess NUE at the crop rotation scale.

AB In organic farming, nitrogen efficiency of potato might vary among cultivars, even within the same maturity type. We therefore analysed in depth the response to nitrogen of a diverse set of cultivars, grown at different locations (differing in soil type and management) and in four years (differing in temperature and rainfall patterns). Yield increased with an increase in nitrogen supply and with growing later cultivars if the crop cycle lasted long enough. When crops had to be flamed to prevent spread of late blight, late cultivars yielded less than early cultivars, especially under high nitrogen. By measuring the fraction of soil covered by green leaves throughout the growing season and using a model, we analysed canopy development in detail and related nitrogen and genotype sensitive model parameters to tuber yield. In one year with early, temporary drought, model prediction was poor. We observed that cultivars that rapidly established a high maximum soil cover, maintained that maximum for long and senesced slowly, could sustain high yields. When late-blight infection was late, these (mid)-late cultivars showed high agronomic nitrogen use efficiency, but were not (always) high in nitrogen uptake efficiency, accumulation of nitrogen in the tubers or nitrogen utilisation efficiency. When late-blight infection started early, early or mid-late cultivars that rapidly established a high maximum soil cover under low nitrogen availability gave best performance. In most years, early canopy development is responsive to nitrogen, shows genetic variation, and is significantly related to early tuber yield. Nitrogen-efficient cultivars suitable for organic production should have rapid early canopy development, a high agronomic nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen utilisation efficiency, but a low nitrogen concentration in the tubers.

AB Ralstonia solanacearum, which consists of five races/biovars, is considered a "species-complex" and is an important phytopathogen that causes wilt disease in more than 200 plant species. R. solanacearum race 1 biovar 4 (R1bv4) has caused yield losses of 30-80 % in the vegetable sweet potato (VSP) in the last decade in Taiwan. To identify the source of the initial inoculum of R1bv4 in VSP fields, soil and cuttings from these fields were examined from 2009 to 2010. The results of the investigation indicated that the population of R1bv4 was generally distributed throughout the natural soil of VSP fields at a density ranging from 1.3 x 10(2) to 9.5 x 10(5) cfu/g soil; however, the incidence of bacterial wilt was not significantly associated with the density of the R1bv4 population in soils (R-2 = 0.084). In contrast, densities of R1bv4 ranging from 2.3 x 10(3) to 5.9 x 10(5) cfu/g tissue were detected in the vine tissue of asymptomatic plants in the fields. Additional experiments demonstrated that R1bv4-free VSP cuttings without visible symptoms planted in infested soils in the greenhouse setting could carry approximately 3.1 x 10(5) R1bv4 cfu/g tissue, which suggests the existence of a latent period for R1bv4 in VSP plants. The results of a BIO-PCR analysis showed that R1bv4 was detected in 2.0 to 98.0 % of the VSP cuttings used for propagation in fields; in addition, the percentage of VSP cuttings carrying R1bv4 and the incidence of bacterial wilt in fields were positively correlated (R-2 = 0.909). The inoculation experiments conducted in greenhouses and in fields showed that the cutting inoculum (CI) contributed more to the incidence of bacterial wilt in VSP plants than the soil inoculum (SI). In the field experiments conducted in 2010, an incidence of disease of 27.1 to 38.5 % was detected in healthy field cuttings 8 months after transplantation; in contrast, the incidence of disease in field cuttings carrying R1bv4 was 49.0 to 68.8 %. The incidence of disease was significantly lower in healthy cuttings than in cuttings carrying R1bv4 (p = 0.05).

AB An improved multiplex RT-PCR assay combined with magnetic nanobeads (MNB-RT-PCR) was developed for simultaneous detection of four sweet potato viruses, Sweet potato virus G (SPVG), Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV), Sweet potato virus C (SPVC) and Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV). Four primer pairs specific for each virus were designed and the corresponding PCR products were 169, 357, 516 and 900 bp in length for SPVG, SPFMV, SPVC and SPCFV, respectively. The specificity of the method was tested using different combinations of virus templates, and the identities of the amplification products were confirmed by sequencing. The limits of detection for all four viruses by single and multiplex MNB-RT-PCR assays were comparable. The assay was further evaluated using laboratory and field samples compared with a conventional CTAB-RT-PCR assay, and the comparative results showed that the MNB-RT-PCR assay was more rapid and sensitive. These results suggest that the multiplex MNB-RT-PCR assay is an effective and preferable method for virus detection in sweet potato.

AB Tarhana chips are a popular traditional fermented food consumed widely in the Kahramanmaras region of Turkey. Tarhana chips are different from many other types of fermented food in that they are produced in the form of tortilla chips. Cereal and yoghurt are the main ingredients in Tarhana chips. Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) levels in dairy and dairy-based products are of concern for human health. To investigate AFM1 contamination, a total of 40 samples were collected from Kahramanmaras region and AFM1 levels were determined by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, physicochemical characteristics of Tarhana chips were investigated and compared with classic fried chips in terms of nutritional value. Based on data obtained from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 21 (52.5%) out of 40 samples contained AFM1 in the range 0.5-36.6 ng/kg, so AFM1 levels of all samples were below the legal limit.

AB Acrylamide content in deep-fried snacks from 20 different production sites of South Indian province of Kerala (80 samples representing 4 important product categories) were determined using a modified high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detector (DAD) method. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification for this method were 1.04 and 3.17 mu g/kg, respectively. The mean recoveries of acrylamide obtained by using spiked samples ranged between 90% and 103%, which shows good extraction efficiency. Acrylamide concentrations in the four groups of snacks ranged from 82.0 to 4245.6 mu g/kg for potato chips, 46.2-2431.4 mu g/kg for jack chips, 24.8-1959.8 mu g/kg for sweet plantain chips and 14.7-1690.5 mu g/kg for plantain chips. These are the most widely consumed snacks in South India, and the results revealed reasonable levels of acrylamide in these foods, which indicated the general risk of consumer exposure.

AB Tomatoes, members of the Solanaceae plant family, produce biologically active secondary metabolites, including glycoalkaloids, which may have both adverse and beneficial biological effects. By using the linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometry, multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments (MS (n) ) were performed to elucidate characteristic fragmentation pathways of the glycoalkaloid alpha-tomatine. High-resolution with high-accuracy mass analysis using an Orbitrap Fourier transform MS (FTMS) with higher-energy CID (HCD) was used to produce mass spectra data across a wide spectral range for confirmation of proposed ion structures and formulae. In addition, a new liquid chromatography method that utilized LTQ Orbitrap MS was developed for the analysis of alpha-tomatine in tomatoes. Recoveries of alpha-tomatine were > 96.0 % with relative standard deviations (RSD) below 7.98 %. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.002 mg/kg. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.005 mg/kg. The linear range was between 0.010 and 10 mg/kg with an excellent correlation coefficient (R (2)) a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 0.9991. Various tomato samples were analyzed for method application, and the level of alpha-tomatine in the 11 samples analyzed ranged from 0.0011to 0.3077 mg/kg.

AB Cutin and suberin represent lipophilic polymers forming plant/environment interfaces in leaves and roots. Despite recent progress in Arabidopsis, there is still a lack on information concerning cutin and suberin synthesis, especially in crops. Based on sequence homology, we isolated two cDNA clones of new cytochrome P450s, CYP77A19 and CYP77A20 from potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum). Both enzymes hydroxylated lauric acid (C12:0) on position -1 to -5. They oxidized fatty acids with chain length ranging from C12 to C18 and catalysed hydroxylation of 16-hydroxypalmitic acid leading to dihydroxypalmitic (DHP) acids, the major C16 cutin and suberin monomers. CYP77A19 also produced epoxides from linoleic acid (C18:2). Exploration of expression pattern in potato by RT-qPCR revealed the presence of transcripts in all tissues tested with the highest expression in the seed compared with leaves. Water stress enhanced their expression level in roots but not in leaves. Application of methyl jasmonate specifically induced CYP77A19 expression. Expression of either gene in the Arabidopsis null mutant cyp77a6-1 defective in flower cutin restored petal cuticular impermeability. Nanoridges were also observed in CYP77A20-expressing lines. However, only very low levels of the major flower cutin monomer 10,16-dihydroxypalmitate and no C18 epoxy monomers were found in the cutin of the complemented lines.

AB Objective: To construct a diet score for assessing degree of adherence to a healthy and environmentally friendly New Nordic Diet (NND) and to investigate its association with adequacy of gestational weight gain and fetal growth in a large prospective birth cohort.
   Design: Main exposure was NND adherence, categorized as low, medium or high adherence. Main outcomes were adequacy of gestational weight gain, described as inadequate, optimal or excessive according to the 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines, and fetal growth, categorized as being small, appropriate or large for gestational age. Associations of NND adherence with gestational weight gain and fetal growth were estimated with multinomial logistic regression in crude and adjusted models.
   Setting: Norway.
   Subjects: Women (n 66 597) from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).
   Results: Higher NND adherence implied higher energy and nutrient intakes, higher nutrient density and a healthier macronutrient distribution. Normal-weight women with high as compared with low NND adherence had lower adjusted odds of excessive gestational weight gain (OR= 0.93; 95 % CI 0.87, 0.99; P= 0.024). High as compared with low NND adherence was associated with reduced odds of the infant being born small for gestational age (OR= 0.92; 95 % CI 0.86, 0.99; P= 0.025) and with higher odds of the baby being born large for gestational age (OR= 1.07; 95 % CI 1.00, 1.15; P= 0.048).
   Conclusions: The NND score captures diet quality. Adherence to a regional diet including a large representation of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, potatoes, fish, game, milk and drinking water during pregnancy may facilitate optimal gestational weight gain in normal-weight women and improve fetal growth in general.

ID FRUIT
AB Objective: To describe the contribution of mixed dishes to vegetable consumption and to estimate vegetable intake according to specific types of vegetables and other foods among US children and adolescents.
   Design: The 2003-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative probability survey conducted in the USA.
   Setting: Civilian non-institutionalized US population.
   Subjects: All children and adolescents aged 2-18 years who met eligibility criteria (n 9169).
   Results: Approximately 59% of total vegetable intake came from whole forms of vegetables with 41% coming from a mixed dish. White potatoes (10.7 (SE 0.6) %), fried potatoes (10.2 (SE 0.4) %), potato chips (8.6 (SE 0.5) %) and other vegetables (9.2 (SE 0.5) %) accounted for most vegetables in their whole forms, whereas pasta dishes (9.5 (SE 0.4) %), chilli/soups/stews (7.0 (SE 0.5) %), pizza/calzones (7.6 (SE 0.3) %) and other foods (13.7 (SE 0.6) %) accounted for most mixed dishes. Usual mean vegetable intake was 1.02 cup equivalents/d; however, after excluding vegetables from mixed dishes, mean intake fell to 0.54 cup equivalents/d and to 0.32 cup equivalents/d when fried potatoes were further excluded.
   Conclusions: Mixed dishes account for nearly half of overall vegetable intake in US children and adolescents. It is critical for future research to examine various components of vegetable intake carefully in order to inform policy and programmatic efforts aimed at improving dietary intake among children and adolescents.

AB The engineering of stomatal activity under water deficit through guard cell-specific gene regulation is an effective approach to improve drought tolerance of crops but it requires an appropriate promoter(s) inducible by water deficit in guard cells. We report that a chimeric promoter can induce guard cell-specific gene expression under water deficit. A chimeric promoter, p4xKST82-rd29B, was constructed using a tetramer of the 82 bp guard cell-specific regulatory region of potato KST1 promoter (4xKST82) and Arabidopsis dehydration-responsive rd29B promoter. Transgenic tobacco plants carrying p4xKST82-rd29B:mGFP-GUS exhibited GUS expression in response to water deficit. GUS enzyme activity of p4xKST82-rd29B:mGFP-GUS transgenic plants increased similar to 300 % by polyethylene glycol treatment compared to that of control plant but not by abscisic acid (ABA), indicating that the p4xKST82-rd29B chimeric promoter can be used to induce the guard cell-specific expression of genes of interest in response to water deficit in an ABA-independent manner.

AB BACKGROUND: Essential oils such as citronella oil exhibit antifungal activity and are potential alternative inhibitors to chemical synthetic fungicides for controlling postharvest diseases. In this study the antifungal activity of citronella oil against Alternaria alternata was investigated.
   RESULTS: In vitro, citronella oil showed strong inhibition activity against A. alternata. The minimum inhibitory concentration in potato dextrose agar and potato dextrose broth medium was determined as 1 and 0.8 mu L mL(-1) respectively. In vivo the disease incidence of Lycopersicon esculentum (cherry tomato) treated with citronella oil was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced compared with the control after 5 days of storage at 25 degrees C and 95% relative humidity. The disease incidence at oil concentrations of 0.2-1.5 mu L mL(-1) was 88-48%. The most effective dosage of the oil was 1.5 mu L mL(-1), with 52% reduction, and the oil had no negative effect on fruit quality. Scanning electron microscopy observation revealed considerably abnormal mycelial morphology.
   CONCLUSION: Citronella oil can significantly inhibit A. alternata in vitro and in vivo and has potential as a promising natural product for controlling black rot in cherry tomato. (C) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Soil-to-plant transfer factors (TFs) are of fundamental importance in assessing the environmental impact due to the presence of radioactivity in soil and agricultural crops. Tapioca and sweet potato, both root crops, are popular foodstuffs for a significant fraction of the Malaysian population, and result in intake of radionuclides. For the natural field conditions experienced in production of these foodstuffs, TFs and the annual effective dose were evaluated for the natural radionuclides Ra-226, Th-232, K-40, a and for the anthropogenic radionuclide Y-88, the latter being a component of fallout. An experimental tapioca field was developed for study of the time dependence of plant uptake. For soil samples from all study locations other than the experimental field, it has been shown that these contain the artificial radionuclide Y-88, although the uptake of Y-88 has only been observed in the roots of the plant Manihot esculenta (from which tapioca is derived) grown in mining soil. The estimated TFs for Ra-226 and Th-232 for tapioca and sweet potato are very much higher than that reported by the IAEA. For all study areas, the annual effective dose from ingestion of tapioca and sweet potato are estimated to be lower than the world average (290 mu Sv y(-1)). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study was designed to isolate endophytic fungi from A. mongholicus (growing in northeast China) to determine whether they can produce bioactive metabolites. Four strains of endophytic fungi (strains 16, 17, 23 and 75) were successfully isolated from A. mongholicus using the surface disinfection method. According to ITS-rDNA sequel-ides analysis, strains 16 and 75 were identified as Fusarium oxysporum, and strains 17 and 23 were identified as Bionectria ochroleuca. We applied the Box-Behnken design (BBD) to optimize the liquid fermentation conditions and obtain the maximum cell dry weight (CDW) yield. Optimal parameters were obtained under the following experimental conditions: temperature of 28 degrees C, potato dextrose agar (PDA) liquid medium of 80 mL and rotation speed of 150 rpm. The four isolated endophytic fungi. did not produce astragalosides I-IV, flavonoids or polysaccharides. Isolation of additional species of endophytic fungi from A. mongholicus and determination of their capacity to produce biologically active substances are subjects in need of further research.

AB Tobacco bushy top disease is a complex disease caused by mixed infection of Tobacco bushy top virus (TBTV), Tobacco vein distorting virus (TVDV), satellite RNA of TBTV (Sat-TBTV) and Tobacco vein distorting virus associate RNA (TVDVaRNA). A one-tube multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay was developed for simultaneous detection of the four causal agents of the disease. Four pairs of specific primers based on the conserved regions of each of the four disease agents were used in the one-tube RT-PCR. The RT-PCR products consisted of fragments of 1049 base pairs (bp) for TBTV, 792 bp for TVDVaRNA, 598 bp for Sat-TBTV and 357 bp for TVDV, and their origins were confirmed by sequencing. Primer concentrations and cycling condition were optimized for the multiplex RT-PCR. The detection limit of the assay was up to 10(-4) dilution. The assay was evaluated using tobacco plants infected naturally with one to four target viruses, transmission vector of aphids and field samples collected from Yunnan, Hunan, and Guizhou province, China. The results show that the multiplex RT-PCR is reliable and sensitive as a simple, rapid and cost-effective method to detect these pathogens in tobacco and aphid. This assay will be useful for virus surveys when large numbers of samples are tested. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FUNGAL SPORES; CONSTANT; DURATION; GROWTH
AB In the environment, fungal conidia are subject to transient conditions. In particular, temperature is varying according to day/night periods. All predictive models for germination assume that fungal spores can adapt instantaneously to changes of temperature. The only study that supports this assumption (Gougouli and Koutsoumanis, 2012, Modelling germination of fungal spores at constant and fluctuating temperature conditions. International journal of Food Microbiology, 152: 153-161) was carried out on Penicillium expansum and Aspergillus niger conidia that, in most cases, already produced germ tubes. In contrast, the present study focuses on temperature shifts applied during the first stages of germination (i.e., before the apparition of the germ tubes). Firstly, germination times were determined in steady state conditions at 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C. Secondly, temperature shifts (e.g., up-shifts and down-shifts) were applied at 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 of germination times, with 5,10 and 15 degrees C magnitudes.
   Experiments were carried out in triplicate on Penicillium chrysogenum conidia on Potato Dextrose Agar medium according to a full factorial design. Statistical analysis of the results clearly demonstrated that the assumption of instantaneous adaptation of the conidia should be rejected. Temperature shifts during germination led to an induced lag time or an extended germination time as compared to the experiments conducted ay steady state. The induced lag time was maximized when the amplitude of the shift was equal to 10 degrees C. Interaction between the instant and the direction of the shift was highlighted. A negative lag time was observed for a 15 degrees C down-shift applied at 1/4 of the germination time. This result suggested that at optimal temperature the rate of germination decreased with time, and that the variation of this rate with time depended on temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The trace of high and low ridge in the Sanyangzhuang village site showed that adopting ridge tillage cultivation technology (RT) in China has a long history of more than 2000 years. In this paper, we reviewed recent advances of the development and application of RI in China. The better yields from crops grown on ridges/furrow compared with those on flat land were attributed mainly to the improvement of soil moisture conditions, better air permeability and effective supply of soil nutrition. However, most studies of RI are mainly concentrated in upland crop. It has not been reported on RT's higher water use efficiency (WUE) and the capacity of drainage & impounding during the rice production process. New systems of ridge tillage & terrace cultivation model (RTT) for irrigated rice are described here. Further research is needed to optimize management strategies and to strengthen basic research for RTT to obtain environmental and economic benefits and to evaluate practicability and effectiveness of RTT in the paddy field.

AB The aim of this study was to model the inactivation of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in pasteurized omelet internally inoculated at different microwave heating treatments (300 W; 450 W, 600 W and 800 W). Results indicated a non significant change in Salmonella populations during the first 30 s treatment at 300 W and 450 W, being log reductions lower than 0.5 log CPU g(-1). However, after 40 s treatment, log reductions had risen to 4.8 log CPU g(-1) at 800 W. Inactivation rates were higher at 600W and 800 W (0.67 and 0.63 s(-1)) than at 300 W and 450 W (<0.34 s(-1)). The temperature-dependent parameters of a Weibull model obtained by Mattick, Legan, Humphrey & Peleg (2001) were evaluated. It was concluded that combinations characterized by a temperature equal or above 70 degrees C ensured a minimum 4 log reduction of Salmonella population (i.e. 300 W-80 s; 450 W-60 s or 600 W/800 W-40 s). These results may be of value in food service establishments, as target treatments for microwavable potato omelet portions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An evaluation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products is essential for their use in scientific studies. We evaluated the accuracy of MODIS NDVI data that were derived from the MOD09GQ and MYD09GQ products using ground-based measurements from nearly one complete growing season (from May 2 to September 28, 2013) for six land-use types in the upper and middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin. The spatial heterogeneity and scale effects of the NDVI were analyzed using TM8 images of the observation sites. A comparison of the field measurements showed that the MODIS NDVI data were correlated with the in situ data and had an R-2 of 0.60-0.98. The semivariance analysis results showed that scale effects were common for MODIS data at a pixel resolution of 250 m for corn, potato, rape, and barley crops. Upscaling the in situ NDVI data using high spatial resolution satellite images can improve the validation accuracy of pixel-level NDVI. The results from this letter provide ground-based NDVI data that are required for the calibration and validation of satellite observations and products.

AB This work discusses efficiency of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment of cellular material with time-variable electric field strength, E. The potato was selected as a model tissue. Computer model, based on electroporation theory, was developed to simulate different strategies of E value changes. In the experimental part of this work, the PEF treatment was applied to disk-shaped and sliced samples using a laboratory compression chamber, equipped with a PEF-treatment system. The experiments were done using PEF generator that provided pulses of near-rectangular shape, the pulse duration was t(i) = 1000 mu s the value of E was varied within 200 and 800 V/cm, and the total time of PEF treatment, t(PEF), was varied within 0 and 0.1 s. The electrical conductivity disintegration index, Z, was used for characterization of the PEF-induced damage of potato tissue. Both theory and experiment predicted the minimum power consumption W-o at the optimal value of E-o approximate to 400 V/cm. The computer simulation predicted that application of protocols with time-variable electric fields would allow optimization of PEF treatment with initial electric field E-i deviating from the optimal value E-o. PEF experiments revealed that exponential increase of E values can be useful at small initial electric field strengths, E < E-o, as far as it allows significant improvement of PEF-treatment efficiency. The PEF experiments with pressing of potato slices have shown that PEF treatment before pressing was more efficient than treatment during the pressing, and the specific energy consumption for the both samples was approximately the same (W approximate to 7.5 kJ/kg).

AB A sol-gel hybrid sorbent, methyltrimethoxysilane-tetraethoxysilane (MTMOS-TEOS) was successfully used as new dispersive solid phase extraction (dSPE) sorbent material in the determination of acrylamide in several Sudanese foods and analysis using GC-MS. Several important dSPE parameters were optimised. Under the optimised conditions, excellent linearity (r(2) > 0.9998) was achieved using matrix matched standard calibration in the concentration range 50-1000 mu g kg(-1). The limits of detection CLOD) and limit of quantification ranged from 9.1 to 12.8 mu g/kg and 27.8-38.9 mu g/kg, respectively. The precision (RSD%) of the method was <= 6.6% and recoveries of acrylamide obtained were in the range of 88-103%, (n = 3). The LOD obtained is comparable with the LODs of primary secondary amine dSPE. The proposed MTMOS-TEOS dSPE method is direct and safe for acrylamide analysis, showed reliable method validation performances and good cleanup effects. It was successfully applied to the analysis of acrylamide in real food samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Potato proteins are of high interest because of their high nutritional quality and multiple health benefits, but they are currently undervalued due to their limited solubility and stability. Glycated patatin (PTT) with galactose, galactooligosaccharides (GOSs) and galactan were produced through the Maillard reaction and characterised structurally and functionally. Fourier-transform infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy data revealed important changes in total secondary structures through glycation with GOSs (61.2%) and galactan (36.7%) and also significant tertiary structural changes leading to an exposure of tryptophan residues. These structural changes led to more heat stable forms of PTT with a higher unfolding temperature (70-90 degrees C) than the unmodified protein (50-70 degrees C) and with higher antioxidant activity. PTT:galactose conjugates exhibited similar thermal stability and pH-structural behaviour to native PTT. However, the high level of galactose conjugation to PTT and increased exposure of hydrophobic residues led to a significant increase in its emulsifying stability at pH 3. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The study investigated the effects of glutinous rice flour (GRF) on the quality of ground pork patties. Ground pork patties with 3% of GRF showed better quality compared to addition of 1% and 5% of GRF. Addition of 3% GRF was further compared with 0.5% carrageenan, 3% soy protein isolate, 3% corn starch and 3% potato starch in ground pork patties. The cooking yield in GRF group was significantly higher than that of other treatments due to the increase in moisture and fat retentions (P < 0.05). Comparing with other groups, GRF showed lower texture profile values for hardness and chewiness (P < 0.05). The ground pork patties with GRF were juicier, more tender and showed better flavor and overall acceptability compared to control and the treatments with other additives (P < 0.05). The results indicate that GRF could be an effective functional ingredient in ground pork patties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Thermal processing as the most prevalent food preservation technique has been extensively studied and used for years. Different modes of agitation that can be employed in the canning process are characterized by relatively different, heat impacts and their associated quality changes. Hence, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of different retort conditions on lethality (F-o), color and textural changes in potato cubes. Process variables employed were: retort temperature: 115, 120, 125 C; agitation orientations: vertical (end-over-end) and horizontal (fixed and bi-axial); agitation speed: 0 (static), 10, 20 rpm. A water immersion single basket rotary retort was retrofitted to simultaneously accommodate agitating modes of rotation. Accumulated process lethality values were calculated for each experimental run. Color quality in terms of parameters such as, yellowness (b-value), total color difference (Delta E values) and textural quality in terms of hardness values were compared for the particles processed under each condition. All process variables had a significant (p < 0.05) influence on F-o, color and texture parameters of potato particles. The quality changes were found to correlate well with the accumulated F-o values achieved during processing. As can be expected, the quality loss increased with an increase in F-o and vice versa.

Physicochemical, pasting and morphological properties of the irradiated starches were investigated. Apparent amylose content, pH, moisture, swelling power and syneresis decreased; whereas carboxyl content, water absorption capacity and solubility increased with increasing irradiation dose. Pasting properties also decreased significantly (p <= 0.05) upon increasing the irradiation dose. Observation under scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed surface cracking of the starch granules by gamma-irradiation which increased with increase in irradiation dose. X-ray diffraction pattern remained the same upon irradiation but a decrease in relative crystallinity was observed with increasing irradiation dose. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Several resistance traits, including the I2 resistance against tomato fusarium wilt, were mapped to the long arm of chromosome 11 of Solanum. However, the structure and evolution of this locus remain poorly understood.
   Results: Comparative analysis showed that the structure and evolutionary patterns of the I2 locus vary considerably between potato and tomato. The I2 homologues from different Solanaceae species usually do not have orthologous relationship, due to duplication, deletion and frequent sequence exchanges. At least 154 sequence exchanges were detected among 76 tomato I2 homologues, but sequence exchanges between I2 homologues in potato is less frequent. Previous study showed that I2 homologues in potato were targeted by miR482. However, our data showed that I2 homologues in tomato were targeted by miR6024 rather than miR482. Furthermore, miR6024 triggers phasiRNAs from I2 homologues in tomato. Sequence analysis showed that miR6024 was originated after the divergence of Solanaceae. We hypothesized that miR6024 and miR482 might have facilitated the expansion of the I2 family in Solanaceae species, since they can minimize their potential toxic effects by down-regulating their expression.
   Conclusions: The I2 locus represents a most divergent resistance gene cluster in Solanum. Its high divergence was partly due to frequent sequence exchanges between homologues. We propose that the successful expansion of I2 homologues in Solanum was at least partially attributed to miRNA mediated regulation.

AB Background: Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (family Closteroviridae, genus Crinivirus) features a large bipartite, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. To date, only three complete genomic sequences of SPCSV can be accessed through GenBank. SPCSV was first detected from China in 2011, only partial genomic sequences have been determined in the country. No report on the complete genomic sequence and genome structure of Chinese SPCSV isolates or the genetic relation between isolates from China and other countries is available.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The complete genomic sequences of five isolates from different areas in China were characterized. This study is the first to report the complete genome sequences of SPCSV from whitefly vectors. Genome structure analysis showed that isolates of WA and EA strains from China have the same coding protein as isolates Can181-9 and m2-47, respectively. Twenty cp genes and four RNA1 partial segments were sequenced and analyzed, and the nucleotide identities of complete genomic, cp, and RNA1 partial sequences were determined. Results indicated high conservation among strains and significant differences between WA and EA strains. Genetic analysis demonstrated that, except for isolates from Guangdong Province, SPCSVs from other areas belong to the WA strain. Genome organization analysis showed that the isolates in this study lack the p22 gene.
   Conclusions/Significance: We presented the complete genome sequences of SPCSV in China. Comparison of nucleotide identities and genome structures between these isolates and previously reported isolates showed slight differences. The nucleotide identities of different SPCSV isolates showed high conservation among strains and significant differences between strains. All nine isolates in this study lacked p22 gene. WA strains were more extensively distributed than EA strains in China. These data provide important insights into the molecular variation and genomic structure of SPCSV in China as well as genetic relationships among isolates from China and other countries.

AB Introduction: Our ability to document insect preference for semiochemicals is pivotal in pest control as these agents can improve monitoring and be deployed within integrated pest management programmes for more efficacious control of pest species. However, methods used to date have drawbacks that limit their utility. We present and test a new concept for determining insect motivation to move towards, or away from, semiochemicals by noting direction and speed of movement as animals work against a defined energy landscape (environmentally dependent variation in the cost of transport) requiring different powers to negotiate. We conducted trials with the pine weevils Hylobius abietis and peach-potato aphids Myzus persicae exposed to various attractants and repellents and placed so that they either moved up defined slopes against gravity or had to travel over variously rough surfaces.
   Results: Linear Mixed Models demonstrated clear reductions in travel speed by insects moving along increasingly energetically taxing energy landscapes but also that responses varied according to different semiochemicals, thus highlighting the value of energy landscapes as a new concept to help measure insect motivation to access or avoid different attractants or repellents across individuals.
   Conclusions: New sensitive, detailed indicators of insect motivation derived from this approach should prove important in pest control across the world.

AB The inheritance of resistance to white tip disease (WTDR) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was analyzed with an artificial inoculation test in a segregating population derived from the cross between Tetep, a highly resistant variety that was identified in a previous study, and a susceptible cultivar. Three resistance-associated traits, including the number of Aphelenchoides besseyi (A. besseyi) individuals in 100 grains (NA), the loss rate of panicle weight (LRPW) and the loss rate of the total grains per panicle (LRGPP) were analyzed for the detection of the quantitative trait locus (QTL) in the population after construction of a genetic map. Six QTLs distributed on chromosomes 3, 5 and 9 were mapped. qNA3 and qNA9, conferring reproduction number of A. besseyi in the panicle, accounted for 16.91% and 12.54% of the total phenotypic variance, respectively. qDRPW5a and qDRPW5b, associated with yield loss, were located at two adjacent marker intervals on chromosome 5 and explained 14.15% and 14.59% of the total phenotypic variation and possessed LOD values of 3.40 and 3.39, respectively. qDRPW9 was considered as a minor QTL and only explained 1.02% of the phenotypic variation. qLRGPP5 contributed to the loss in the number of grains and explained 10.91% of the phenotypic variation. This study provides useful information for the breeding of resistant cultivars against white tip disease in rice.

AB The structure and function of the plant microbiome is driven by plant species and prevailing environmental conditions. Effectuated by breeding efforts, modern crops diverge genetically and phenotypically from their wild relatives but little is known about consequences for the associated microbiota. Therefore, we studied bacterial rhizosphere communities associated with the wild beet B. vulgans ssp. mantima grown in their natural habitat soil from coastal drift lines (CS) and modern sugar beets (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) cultivated in CS and potting soil (PS) under greenhouse conditions. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene fingerprints and pyrosequencing-based amplicon libraries revealed plant genotype- and soil-specific microbiomes. Wild beet plants harbor distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and a more diverse bacterial community than the domesticated sugar beet plants. Although the rhizospheres of both plant genotypes were dominated by Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes, 375% of dominant OTUs were additionally detected in the wild beet rhizosphere. Analysis of the cultivable fraction confirmed these plant genotype-specific differences at functional level. The proportion of isolates displayed in vitro activity against phytopathogens was lower for wild beet (<= 45.8%) than for sugar beet (<= 575%). Conversely, active isolates from the wild beet exhibited stronger ability to cope with abiotic stresses. From all samples, active isolates of Stenotrophomonas rhizophila were frequently identified. In addition, soil type-specific impacts on the composition of bacterial communities were found: Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes were only detected in plants cultivated in CS; whereas Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria dominated in PS. Overall, in comparison to modern sugar beets, wild beets were associated with taxonomically and functionally distinct microbiomes.

AB The growing demand for renewable fuels has driven the interest in the utilization of alternative waste materials such as potato peel waste (PPW) which contains fermentable carbohydrate. Fermentation of PPW using a mixed microbial consortium yielded about 60% unreacted PPW fermentation residue (PPW-FR). The PPW and PPW-FR were characterized by a combination of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to quantify changes after fermentation. Fermentation of PPW resulted in fermentation of starch and concentrating lignin plus suberin and lipids in PPW-FR. TGA analysis showed that decomposition peaks differed for PPW (423 degrees C) and PPW-FR (457 degrees C). Pyrolysis-GC/MS showed an increase in phenolic and long chain fatty acid compounds with a concomitant decrease in carbohydrate derived compounds in the PPW after fermentation. Both the PPW and PPW-FR have shown potential based on properties to be converted into crude biofuel via thermochemical processes.

AB We previously reported successful cryopreservation of shoot tips of potato 'Zihuabai' by three vitrification-based protocols. In the present study, cryo-injury to shoot tips and genetic stability in regenerants recovered from cryopreserved shoot tips by the three vitrification-based protocols were further investigated. The results showed that sucrose preculture caused no obviously different injuries, while dehydration with plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS2) was the step causing major damage to cells of shoot tips, regardless of the cryogenic procedures. Compared with droplet-vitrification and encapsulation-vitrification, vitrification caused the most severe injury to cells of the shoot tips, thus resulting in much longer time duration for shoot recovery and much lower shoot regrowth rate. Cells in apical dome and the youngest leaf primordia were able to survive and subsequently some of them regrew into shoots following all three vitrification-based cryopreservation procedures. Analyses using intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers in shoots regrown from all three vitrification-based protocols did not find any polymorphic bands. The results reported here suggest that vitrification-based cryo-procedures can be considered promising methods for long-term preservation of potato genetic resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB To meet mounting water demands, treated wastewater has become an important source of irrigation. Thus, contamination of treated wastewater by pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) and the fate of these compounds in the agricultural environment are of increasing concern. This field study aimed to quantify PC uptake by treated wastewater-irrigated root crops (carrots and sweet potatoes) grown in lysimeters and to evaluate potential risks. In both crops, the nonionic PCs (carbamazepine, caffeine, and lamotrigine) were detected at significantly higher concentrations than ionic PCs (metoprolol, bezafibrate, dofibric acid, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, and sildenafil). PCs in leaves were found at higher concentrations than in the roots. Carbamazepine metabolites were found mainly in the leaves, where the concentration of the metabolite 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine was significantly higher than the parent compound. The health risk associated with consumption of wastewater-irrigated root vegetables was estimated using the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) approach. Our data show that the TTC value of lamotrigine can be reached for a child at a daily consumption of half a carrot (similar to 60 g). This study highlights that certain PCs accumulated in edible organs at concentrations above the TTC value should be categorized as contaminants of emerging concern.

AB Background: Pesticide resistance due to sodium channel point mutations has been well documented in many mosquito species.
   Methods: We tested the resistance of six, wild, Chinese populations of the mosquito Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus to deltamethrin and cyhalothrin. The full length of the sodium channel gene was cloned and sequenced from a pooled sample of mosquitoes from each population.
   Results: Seven amino acid alterations were found (V250M, R436K, M943V, I973T, L1035F, L1035S and E1901D). Correlation between the frequencies of these mutations and the level of pesticide resistance (LC50) associated with them indicates that those at position L1035 (corresponding to position L1014F in the house fly, Musca domestica; GenBank Accession No.: X96668) are associated with resistance to deltamethrin and cyhalothrin. The frequency of the L1035F mutation was significantly correlated with resistance to deltamethrin (R-2 = 0.536, P = 0.049) and cyhalothrin (R-2 = 0.626, P = 0.030), and the combined frequency of the L1035F and L1035S mutations was significantly correlated with resistance to both deltamethrin (R-2 = 0.661, P = 0.025), and cyhalothrin (R-2 = 0.803, P = 0.008). None of the other mutations were correlated with either deltamethrin or cyhalothrin resistance. Interestingly, an HWE test indicated significant linkage between the M943V and I973T mutations (P < 0.01), but further research is required to determine the biological significance of this linkage.
   Conclusions: Identifying these mutations may be of practical benefit to the development of pesticide resistance management programs.

AB Soil moisture is one the most limiting factors for crop production. In temperate climates yields are reduced by both water deficit and excess. To calculate the impact of water limitations, alternative water balance schemes were added to the potato production model POMOD (POtato MODel) to keep the soil moisture content within its optimal range. The effects of irrigation, drainage and both together were investigated. Calculations were carried out for three Estonian locations (Tallinn, Tartu and Kuressaare) and two varieties.
   For the reference run the yields were higher for the late variety and lowest in dry Kuressaare. The average irrigation requirement was 30-45 mm for the early and 47-58 mm for the late variety in continental locations, but over two times higher in insular Kuressaare. In continental stations the need for drainage was 30-40 mm per growing period in addition to natural outflow (about 20-25 mm more without outflow). In Kuressaare the mean amount of excess precipitation was only 9-20 mm and its removal had a mostly negative effect on yield due to increasing water deficit during the following dry period. In over half of the years the crops suffered from both water shortage and excess. The greatest increase in yield was achieved when both drainage and irrigation were applied. The benefit from irrigation alone was also considerable, more for the late variety and in Kuressaare. The effect of drainage was most evident in conditions of restricted outflow The negative effects of drainage on yield, as observed in years when drainage led to increasing water deficit in subsequent periods, lowered the average impact of drainage. However, in some cases the highest yield losses were observed in years with excess water. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Potato (Solanum tuberosum L) is considered a drought sensitive crop. Accurate simulation of root growth is critical for estimating water uptake dynamics. However, data required to build and test advanced potato root simulation approaches is lacking. Previously unpublished data from our soil-plant-atmosphere-research (SPAR) chambers was used to evaluate a new two-dimensional diffusive root growth module linked to the existing potato model SPUDSIM. The root module consisted of diffusive parameters controlling the direction of root growth in horizontal and vertical directions, and an additional convective term for vertical growth within the soil. This modified SPUDSIM was tested against observed SPAR data which consisted of root distribution in the soil profile and organ dry weights (DW) at harvest, plus daily water uptake patterns for each of six different irrigation treatments. The difference between simulated and observed DW data was within two standard errors for most plant organs-root DW was over-predicted for well-watered plants. Spatial and temporal patterns of root distribution and water contents were reproduced well. However, the model tended to over-estimate water uptake from soil layers closer to the surface. Differences in simulated root growth patterns among irrigation treatments were the result of fluctuations in soil water status, bulk density, and root density which, in turn, affected the amount of carbon allocated to the roots in different soil layers and the value of the convective term. These results suggest the new module will provide more reliable predictions of potato water uptake for improved agricultural decision support tools. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Orange peel-derived pectin jelly/corn starch-based biocomposite films with and without layered silicates (LSs) were prepared using melt extrusion followed by film die casting. To enhance interfacial compatibility, corn starch and LSs were chemically modified. Regardless of chemical modification or LS weight content, different pectin jelly-to-starch weight ratios (63/37, 60/40, 57/43, and 54/46) were considered to formulate the ingredients of biocomposite films in light of Taguchi-based predictions. X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanned electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were systematically used to characterize corn starch, LSs, and biocomposite films. Among all the films considered, pectin jelly/modified (15%) starch-based biocomposite film (54/46 w/w) containing 0.25 wt % of pristine LSs was found to be the most promising in terms of texture structure and mechanical integrity. Furthermore, creep recovery, hydrophobicity, and water vapor and oxygen gas transmission rates of the most promising biocomposite film were experimentally determined. Based on the findings obtained, the overall performance of the biocomposite film was evaluated and weighed against the overall performance of a low-density polyethylene film.

AB The effects of single-retrogradation (SR), dual-retrogradation (DR) and triple-retrogradation (TR) treatments on in vitro digestibility and structural characteristics of waxy wheat starch were investigated. The yield of slowly digestible starch in a DR-treated starch with retrogradation time interval of 48 h reached a maximum of 44.41%. The gelatinization temperature range and gelatinization enthalpy of DR-treated starch samples were the lowest. Moreover, compared with native starch, X-ray diffraction patterns of treated starches were altered from A-type to B-type and relative crystallinity was significantly decreased, which was responsible for the interaction between amylose-amylose and/or amylose-amylopectin chains that may generate more imperfect structures. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that compared with SR-treated and TR-treated starches, the surface of DR-treated starch with a retrogradation time interval of 48 h exhibited a net-like structure with numerous cavities. These results suggest that structural changes of waxy wheat starch by cycled retrogradation treatment significantly affect digestibility, and DR treatment can be used for preparing SDS product.

AB Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have crucial roles in the regulation of plant development and in plant responses to stress. Plant recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns or pathogen-derived effector proteins has been shown to trigger activation of several MAPKs. This then controls defence responses, including synthesis and/or signalling of defence hormones and activation of defence related genes. The MAPK cascade genes are highly complex and interconnected, and thus the precise signalling mechanisms in specific plant-pathogen interactions are still not known. Here we investigated the MAPK signalling network involved in immune responses of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) to Potato virus Y, an important potato pathogen worldwide. Sequence analysis was performed to identify the complete MAPK kinase (MKK) family in potato, and to identify those regulated in the hypersensitive resistance response to Potato virus Y infection. Arabidopsis has 10 MKK family members, of which we identified five in potato and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), and eight in Nicotiana benthamiana. Among these, StMKK6 is the most strongly regulated gene in response to Potato virus Y. The salicylic acid treatment revealed that StMKK6 is regulated by the hormone that is in agreement with the salicylic acid-regulated domains found in the StMKK6 promoter. The involvement of StMKK6 in potato defence response was confirmed by localisation studies, where StMKK6 accumulated strongly only in Potato-virus-Y-infected plants, and predominantly in the cell nucleus. Using a yeast two-hybrid method, we identified three StMKK6 targets downstream in the MAPK cascade: StMAPK4_2, StMAPK6 and StMAPK13. These data together provide further insight into the StMKK6 signalling module and its involvement in plant defence.

AB This paper presents the first study describing the isolation; cloning and characterization of a full length gene encoding Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor (RbTI) from rice bean (Vigna umbellata). A full-length protease inhibitor gene with complete open reading frame of 327 bp encoding 109 amino acids was cloned from rice bean seeds using degenerate primer set. BlastP search revealed that the RbTI encoded amino acid of approx 13.0 kDa and shared 99% homology each with BBI from Phaseolus parvulus, Vigna trilobata and Vigna vexilata. Phylogenetic tree also showed close relationship of RbTI with BBI from other members of Leguminaceae family. RbTI gene was further confirmed as intronless (GenBank accession no. KJ159908). The secondary and 3D-structural models for the RbTI were predicted with homology modeling. qRT-PCR studies revealed the highest RbTI expression in the seeds nearing maturity, whereas the low expression of the gene was noticed in young leaves. The isolated RbTI was successfully expressed in Escherichia coil and the highest expression was recorded after 5.5 h of induction. Study on the inhibitory activity of expressed protein against the gut proteases of Hessian fly larvae revealed 87% inhibition. The novel RbTI gene will further broaden the pool of plant defense genes and could be an ideal choice for developing transgenic crops resistant to insect pests with high economic value. In addition, it has the potential to be used as a probe for selection of insect- and pathogen-resistant genotypes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Surimi-starch gels, with potato native starch, showed higher hardness, chewiness, whiteness, and gel strength compared with those with corn starch. Potato native starch AP1500 and its modified starches, including acetate esterified starch STABI-AP0170, cross-linked and esterified starch DURA-MIP0075, improved textural properties and whiteness of surimi-starch gels significantly, whereas potato oxidized starch Flu-XP0450 weakened surimi-starch gel forming ability.

TI Vital Signs: Fruit and Vegetable Intake Among Children - United States,

SO MMWR-MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT
LA English
DT Article
ID DIETARY-INTAKE
AB Background: Eating more fruits and vegetables adds underconsumed nutrients to diets, reduces the risks for leading causes of illness and death, and helps manage body weight. This report describes trends in the contributions of fruits and vegetables to the diets of children aged 2-18 years.
   Methods: CDC analyzed 1 day of 24-hour dietary recalls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2003 to 2010 to estimate trends in children's fruit and vegetable intake in cup-equivalents per 1,000 calories (CEPC) and trends by sex, age, race/ethnicity, family income to poverty ratio, and obesity status. Total fruit includes whole fruit (all fruit excluding juice) and fruit juice (from 100% juice, foods, and other beverages). Total vegetables include those encouraged in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 (i.e., dark green, orange, and red vegetables and legumes), white potatoes, and all other vegetables.
   Results: Total fruit intake among children increased from 0.55 CEPC in 2003-2004 to 0.62 in 2009-2010 because of significant increases in whole fruit intake (0.24 to 0.40 CEPC). Over this period, fruit juice intake significantly decreased (0.31 to 0.22 CEPC). Total vegetable intake did not change (0.54 to 0.53 CEPC). No socio-demographic group met the Healthy People 2020 target of 1.1 CEPC vegetables, and only children aged 2-5 years met the target of 0.9 CEPC fruits.
   Conclusions: Children's total fruit intake increased because of increases in whole fruit consumption, but total vegetable intake remained unchanged.
   Implications for Public Health Practice: Increased attention to the policies and food environments in multiple settings, including schools, early care and education, and homes might help continue the progress in fruit intake and improve vegetable intake.

AB A new method for determining the relative crystallinity (RC) of chickpea starch was developed by using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, based on hypotheses as described as follows: there is a Gaussian holocrystalline-peak (HCP) in the 800-1300cm(-1) region of FT-IR spectrum of starch which is divided into amorphous region and crystalline region; the crystalline region of HCP is the overlap of the HCP and the FT-IR spectrum of starch; the RC of starch is the ratio of the area of crystalline region to the area of HCP. It was found that there was no significant difference between the RC determined by FT-IR method and that determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. The intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.998 (p=0.000, n=9) and the 95% confidence interval was 0.992-1.000 for the RC determined by XRD and FT-IR. Furthermore, the developed method showed good repeatability (coefficient of variation (CV), 1.1-2.9%) and good intermediate precision (CV, 2.8%). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmentally friendly silver nanocomposite films were prepared by an ex situ method consisting firstly in the preparation of colloidal silver dispersions and secondly in the dispersion of the as-prepared nanoparticles in a potato starch/glycerol matrix, keeping a green chemistry process all along the synthesis steps. In the first step concerned with the preparation of the colloidal silver dispersions, water, glucose and soluble starch were used as solvent, reducing agent and stabilizing agent, respectively. The influences of the glucose amount and reaction time were investigated on the size and size distribution of the silver nanoparticles. Two distinct silver nanoparticle populations in size (diameter around 5 nm size for the first one and from 20 to 50 nm for the second one) were distinguished and still highlighted in the potato starch/glycerol based nanocomposite films. It was remarkable that lower nanoparticle mean sizes were evidenced by both TEM and UV-vis analyses in the nanocomposites in comparison to the respective colloidal silver dispersions. A dispersion mechanism based on the potential interactions developed between the nanoparticles and the polymer matrix and on the polymer chain lengths was proposed to explain this morphology. These nanocomposite film series can be viewed as a promising candidate for many applications in antimicrobial packaging, biomedicines and sensors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Potato tubers under wounding stress synthesize chlorogenic acid isomers, which are phenolic compounds that prevent chronic diseases. The biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in plants requires aromatic amino acids that are produced from sugars. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that the wound-induced accumulation of chlorogenic acid isomers in potatoes could be enhanced if the availability of sugars is increased by exogenous amylolytic enzymes applied to the surface of the site of wounding. To test this hypothesis, wounded potatoes stored at 20 degrees C were treated with amylolytic enzymes (pullulanase and amyloglucosidase, 282 units/mL, 10 mL/kg) after being stored for 0 (E0h), 48 (E48h), or 96 h (E96h). The highest level of accumulation of total chlorogenic acid isomers (similar to 210% higher than that of time Oh samples) was observed after storage for 120 h for the E96h treatment. The results suggest that increasing the availability of carbon sources needed for the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds would trigger their accumulation in wounded plants.

AB Potato (Solarium tuberosum L.) is a worldwide food staple, but substantial waste accompanies the cultivation of this crop due to wounding of the outer skin and subsequent unfavorable healing conditions. Motivated by both economic and nutritional considerations, this metabolite profiling study aims to improve understanding of closing layer and wound periderm formation and guide the development of new methods to ensure faster and more complete healing after skin breakage. The polar metabolites of wound-healing tissues from four potato cultivars with differing patterns of tuber skin russeting (Norkotah Russet, Atlantic, Chipeta, and Yukon Gold) were analyzed at three and seven days after wounding, during suberized closing layer formation and nascent wound periderm development, respectively. The polar extracts were assessed using LC-MS and NMR spectroscopic methods, including multivariate analysis and tentative identification of 22 of the 24 biomarkers that discriminate among the cultivars at a given wound-healing time point or between developmental stages. Differences among the metabolites that could be identified from NMR- and MS-derived biomarkers highlight the strengths and limitations of each method, also demonstrating the complementarity of these approaches in terms of assembling a complete molecular picture of the tissue extracts. Both methods revealed that differences among the cultivar metabolite profiles diminish as healing proceeds during the period following wounding. The biomarkers included polyphenolic amines, flavonoid glycosides, phenolic acids and glycoalkaloids. Because wound healing is associated with oxidative stress, the free radical scavenging activities of the extracts from different cultivars were measured at each wounding time point, revealing significantly higher scavenging activity of the Yukon Gold periderm especially after 7 days of wounding.

AB The effects of two entomopathogenic fungal endophytes, Beauveria bassiana and Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus), were assessed on the reproduction of cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (Homoptera:Aphididae), through in planta feeding trials. In replicate greenhouse and field trials, cotton plants (Gossypium hirsutum) were inoculated as seed treatments with two concentrations of B. bassiana or P. lilacinum conidia. Positive colonization of cotton by the endophytes was confirmed through potato dextrose agar (PDA) media plating and PCR analysis. Inoculation and colonization of cotton by either B. bassiana or P. lilacinum negatively affected aphid reproduction over periods of seven and 14 days in a series of greenhouse trials. Field trials were conducted in the summers of 2012 and 2013 in which cotton plants inoculated as seed treatments with B. bassiana and P. lilacinum were exposed to cotton aphids for 14 days. There was a significant overall effect of endophyte treatment on the number of cotton aphids per plant. Plants inoculated with B. bassiana had significantly lower numbers of aphids across both years. The number of aphids on plants inoculated with P. lilacinum exhibited a similar, but non-significant, reduction in numbers relative to control plants. We also tested the pathogenicity of both P. lilacinum and B. bassiana strains used in the experiments against cotton aphids in a survival experiment where 60% and 57% of treated aphids, respectively, died from infection over seven days versus 10% mortality among control insects. Our results demonstrate (i) the successful establishment of P. lilacinum and B. bassiana as endophytes in cotton via seed inoculation, (ii) subsequent negative effects of the presence of both target endophytes on cotton aphid reproduction using whole plant assays, and (iii) that the P. lilacinum strain used is both endophytic and pathogenic to cotton aphids. Our results illustrate the potential of using these endophytes for the biological control of aphids and other herbivores under greenhouse and field conditions.

AB Aspergillus penicillioides is a true halophile, present in diverse econiches - from the hypersaline athalassohaline, and thalassohaline environments, to polyhaline systems, and in different geographical locations. Twenty seven isolates from these environments, were seen to be moderate halophiles, euryhaline in nature. They had an obligate need of a low a(w) and were unable to grow on a regular defined medium such as Czapek Dox Agar, as well as on varied nutrient rich agar media such as Malt Extract, Potato Dextrose and Sabouraud Agar; however, growth was obtained on all these media when amended with 10% solar salt. In absence of added salt, the conidia either did not germinate, or when germinated, distortions and lysis were seen in the short mycelial forms; on media with salt, the mycelia and vesicles appeared normal.

AB Background: 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (Lso) is a phloem-limited alphaproteobacterium associated with the devastating zebra chip disease of potato (Solanum tuberosum). Like other members of Liberibacter, Lso-ZC1 encodes a flagellin domain-containing protein (Fla(Lso)) with a conserved 22 amino-acid peptide (flg22(Lso)). To understand the innate immune responses triggered by this unculturable intracellular bacterium, we studied the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that triggered immunity in Nicotiana benthamiana, using the flg22(Lso) peptide and the full length fla(Lso) gene.
   Results: Our results showed that the expression of fla(Lso) via Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression induced a slow necrotic cell death in the inoculated leaves of N. benthamiana, which was coupled with a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, the expression of several representative genes involved in innate immunity was transiently up-regulated by the flg22(Lso) in N. benthamiana. The Fla(Lso), however, induced stronger up-regulation of these representative genes compared to the flg22(Ls)o, especially that of flagellin receptor FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2) and respiratory burst oxidase (RbohB) in N. benthamiana. Although neither cell death nor ROS were induced by the synthetic flg22(Lso), a weak callose deposition was observed in infiltrated leaves of tobacco, tomato, and potato plants.
   Conclusion: The flagellin of Lso and its functional domain, flg22(Lso) share characteristics of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and trigger unique innate immune responses in N. benthamiana. Slow and weak activation of the innate immune response in host plants by the flagellin of Lso may reflect the nature of its intracellular life cycle. Our findings provide new insights into the role of the Lso flagellin in the development of potato zebra chip disease and potential application in breeding for resistance.

AB In view of the transition to hydrogen as a major energy carrier in the future, new routes for bringing down the cost of biological hydrogen production need to be explored. The current study was devoted to optimizing the dark fermentation by Escherichia coil HD701 for hydrogen production from an acid-hydrolyzed potato starch residue stream without nitrogen sparging to reduce the cost. To further increase the economic feasibility of hydrogen production by E. coil, this study explores the use of the waste culture after hydrogen production in mass scale one-pot green synthesis of silver nanoparticles.
   Hydrogen gas production by E. coli was conducted from an optimum 10 g/L reducing sugars of acid-hydrolyzed potato starch residue stream. At low initial bacterial optical density OD600 of 0.02, the optimum air space was 3% of the fermentor for hydrogen production without nitrogen sparging. However, the cumulative hydrogen gas produced was 17% lower than that of the hydrogen produced after nitrogen sparging. Increasing the initial bacterial optical density OD600 increased the cumulative hydrogen produced up to that of the nitrogen sparged control. The initial bacterial optical density of 0.04 was optimum for hydrogen production without nitrogen sparging producing 0.444 mol/mole glucose compared to 0.448 mol/mole glucose obtained after nitrogen sparging. Eliminating the nitrogen sparging step extended the lag phase of the hydrogen production profile, but the slight increase in the initial bacterial optical density enhanced the rate of hydrogen formation at the log phase. The waste culture after hydrogen production could be efficiently used in one-pot mass scale green synthesis of silver nanoparticles.
   The waste culture after hydrogen production was autoclaved and centrifuged. The supernatant containing the bacterial cell extracts after autoclaving and the fermentation residual reducing sugars was used for bioreduction of silver ions into nanoparticles at 15 psi and 121 degrees C for only 5 min. Silver nanoparticles with a size range of 5-25 nm and an average nanoparticles size of 15.6 +/- 2.46 nm, as analyzed using transmission electron microscopy, were obtained at an optimum of pH 7 and 10 mM silver nitrate. The synthesized nanoparticles had a reddish-brown color in aqueous solution and showed the typical wavelength spectrum of silver nanoparticles with a maximum wavelength of 430 nm. The use of the waste culture after hydrogen production for fast one-pot mass scale green synthesis of silver nanoparticles suggests interlinking the two biotechnologies in future applications to increase the economic feasibility of both biotechnologies.

AB Microorganisms play essential roles in almost every environment on earth. For instance, microbes decompose organic material, or establish symbiotic relationships that range from pathogenic to mutualistic. Symbiotic relationships have been particularly well studied for microbial plant pathogens and have emphasized the role of effectors; secreted molecules that support host colonization. Most effectors characterized thus far play roles in deregulation of host immunity. Arguably, however, pathogens not only deal with immune responses during host colonization, but also encounter other microbes including competitors, (myco)parasites and even potential co-operators. Thus, part of the effector catalog may target microbiome co-inhabitants rather than host physiology.

TI Molecular Cloning and Functional Characterization of the Lycopene

AB Lycopene epsilon-cyclase (epsilon-LCY) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of alpha-branch carotenoids through the cyclization of lycopene. Two cDNA molecules encoding epsilon-LCY (designated Nt epsilon-LCY1 and Nt epsilon-LCY2) were cloned from Nicotiana tabacum. Nt epsilon-LCY1 and Nt epsilon-LCY2 are encoded by two distinct genes with different evolutionary origins, one originating from the tobacco progenitor, Nicotiana sylvestris, and the other originating from Nicotiana tomentosiformis. The two coding regions are 97% identical at the nucleotide level and 95% identical at the amino acid level. Transcripts of Nt epsilon-LCY were detectable in both vegetative and reproductive organs, with a relatively higher level of expression in leaves than in other tissues. Subcellular localization experiments using an Nt epsilon-LCY1-GFP fusion protein demonstrated that mature Nt epsilon-LCY1 protein is localized within the chloroplast in Bright Yellow 2 suspension cells. Under low-temperature and low-irradiation stress, Nt epsilon-LCY transcript levels substantially increased relative to control plants. Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-mediated silencing of epsilon-LCY in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in an increase of beta-branch carotenoids and a reduction in the levels of alpha-branch carotenoids. Meanwhile, transcripts of related genes in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway observably increased, with the exception of beta-OHase in the TRV-epsilon-lcy line. Suppression of epsilon-LCY expression was also found to alleviate photoinhibition of Potosystem II in virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) plants under low-temperature and low-irradiation stress. Our results provide insight into the regulatory role of epsilon-LCY in plant carotenoid biosynthesis and suggest a role for epsilon-LCY in positively modulating low temperature stress responses.

TI Genetic Evidence That Chain Length and Branch Point Distributions Are

AB The major component of starch is the branched glucan amylopectin. Structural features of amylopectin, such as the branching pattern and the chain length distribution, are thought to be key factors that enable it to form semicrystalline starch granules. We varied both structural parameters by creating Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants lacking combinations of starch synthases (SSs) SS1, SS2, and SS3 (to vary chain lengths) and the debranching enzyme ISOAMYLASE1-ISOAMYLASE2 (ISA; to alter branching pattern). The isa mutant accumulates primarily phytoglycogen in leaf mesophyll cells, with only small amounts of starch in other cell types (epidermis and bundle sheath cells). This balance can be significantly shifted by mutating different SSs. Mutation of SS1 promoted starch synthesis, restoring granules in mesophyll cell plastids. Mutation of SS2 decreased starch synthesis, abolishing granules in epidermal and bundle sheath cells. Thus, the types of SSs present affect the crystallinity and thus the solubility of the glucans made, compensating for or compounding the effects of an aberrant branching pattern. Interestingly, ss2 mutant plants contained small amounts of phytoglycogen in addition to aberrant starch. Likewise, ss2ss3 plants contained phytoglycogen, but were almost devoid of glucan despite retaining other SS isoforms. Surprisingly, glucan production was restored in the ss2ss3isa triple mutants, indicating that SS activity in ss2ss3 per se is not limiting but that the isoamylase suppresses glucan accumulation. We conclude that loss of only SSs can cause phytoglycogen production. This is readily degraded by isoamylase and other enzymes so it does not accumulate and was previously unnoticed.

AB The relationships among sedentary time, television viewing time, and dietary patterns in children are not fully understood. The aim of this paper was to determine which of self-reported television viewing time or objectively measured sedentary time is a better correlate of the frequency of consumption of healthy and unhealthy foods. A cross-sectional study was conducted of 9- to 11-year-old children (n = 523; 57.1% female) from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Accelerometers were used to determine total sedentary time, and questionnaires were used to determine the number of hours of television watching and the frequency of consumption of foods per week. Television viewing was negatively associated with the frequency of consumption of fruits, vegetables, and green vegetables, and positively associated with the frequency of consumption of sweets, soft drinks, diet soft drinks, pastries, potato chips, French fries, fruit juices, ice cream, fried foods, and fast food. Except for diet soft drinks and fruit juices, these associations were independent of covariates, including sedentary time. Total sedentary time was negatively associated with the frequency of consumption of sports drinks, independent of covariates, including television viewing. In combined sedentary time and television viewing analyses, children watching >2 h of television per day consumed several unhealthy food items more frequently than did children watching = 2 h of television, regardless of sedentary time. In conclusion, this paper provides evidence to suggest that television viewing time is more strongly associated with unhealthy dietary patterns than is total sedentary time. Future research should focus on reducing television viewing time, as a means of improving dietary patterns and potentially reducing childhood obesity.

AB This paper reports on the results of using unbleached sugar cane bagasse nanofibres (average diameter 26.5 nm; aspect ratio 247 assuming a dry fibre density of 1,500 kg/m(3)) to improve the physico-chemical properties of starch-based films. The addition of bagasse nanofibres (2.5 to 20 wt%) to modified potato starch (i.e. soluble starch) reduced the moisture uptake by up to 17 % at 58 % relative humidity. The film's tensile strength and Young's modulus increased by up to 100 % (3.1 to 6.2 MPa) and 300 % (66.3 to 198.3 MPa) respectively with 10 and 20 wt% fibre addition. However, the strain at yield dropped by 50 % for the film containing 10 wt% fibre. Models for composite materials were used to account for the strong interactions between the nanofibres and the starch matrix. The storage and loss moduli as well as the glass transition temperature (T-g) obtained from dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, were increased with the starch-nanofibre films indicating decreased starch chain mobility due to the interacting effect of the nanofibres. Evidence of the existence of strong interactions between the starch matrix and the nanofibres was revealed from detailed Fourier transform infra-red and scanning electron microscopic evaluation.

AB The dried rhizomes of Veratrum album were individually extracted with CHCl3, acetone, and NH4OH/benzene to test the toxic effects against the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, which is an important agricultural pest. Fifteen compounds in various amounts were isolated from the extracts using column and thin-layer chromatography. The chemical structures of 14 compounds were characterized as octacosan-1-ol (1), -sitosterol (2), stearic acid (3), diosgenin (4), resveratrol (5), wittifuran X (6), oxyresveratrol (7), -sitosterol 3-O--D-glucopyranoside (8), diosgenin 3-O--L-rhamnopyranosyl-(12)--D-glucopyronoside (9), oxyresveratrol 3-O--D-glucopyranoside (10), jervine (11), pseudojervine (13), 5,6-dihydro-1-hydroxyjervine (14), and saccharose (15) using UV, IR, MS, H-1- and C-13-NMR, and 2D-NMR spectroscopic methods. However, the chemical structure of 12, an oligosaccharide, has not fully been elucidated. Compounds 4, 6, 9, and 10 were isolated from V. album rhizomes for the first time in the current study. The toxic effects of three extracts (acetone, CHCl3, and NH4OH/benzene) and six metabolites, 2, 2+4, 5, 7, 8, and 11, were evaluated against the Colorado potato beetle. The assay revealed that all three extracts, and compounds 7, 8, and 11 exhibited potent toxic effects against this pest. This is the first report on the evaluation of the toxic effects of the extracts and secondary metabolites of V. album rhizomes against L. decemlineata. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the extracts can be used as natural insecticides.

ID VARIETY; REGRESSION
AB Various workers have attempted to develop a root piece planting system for sweetpotato, similar to the system used commercially for potato, but attempts to select and breed sweetpotato clones adapted to root piece planting have met with mixed success. It has been hypothesized this is the result of significant genotype x environment effects, which are complicating phenotype screening. The aim of this work was to investigate genotype x environment interactions and yield stability of sweetpotato grown from cut root pieces. Ten sweetpotato clones were grown from cut root pieces in three locations over three seasons at sites in North Carolina and Mississippi. The study found sweetpotato clones grown from root pieces were influenced by both genetic and environmental factors and that the interaction was often complicated and dependent on the trait being measured. A significant genotype x environment interaction and yield instability were found to be present. Further work will be required to understand the nature of the genotype x environment effects; however, the results suggest programs aiming to develop sweetpotato clones adapted to root piece planting will need to use appropriate multienvironment screening so as to account for genotype x environment effects.

AB An in vitro photoautotrophic step based on the supply of CO2-enriched air (1,600 mu mol mol(-1)) during the light phase and ambient air (350 mu mol mol(-1) CO2) during the dark phase has been used to promote the ex vitro establishment of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) seedlings. The introduction of this step into a previously developed in vitro protocol was found to improve the quality of the seedlings (as assessed by fresh weight increase, physical stature, leaf area and thickness, stomatal density, and chlorophyll a content, and primary and secondary root production), the proportion of seedlings successfully transferred to soil (improvement from 40% to 100%) and achieved in a shorter time (reduction from 10 to 6 mo). Best results using this photoautotrophic growth step were obtained when a low medium concentration of sucrose (43.8 mM or lower) was used, when it was applied to seedlings that had already reached 4 or 5 mo of age in the in vitro culture step, and when seedlings were cultured in the photoautotrophic system for 2 mo or more before transfer to soil. Our improved protocol is more efficient and it reduces the cost per plant for the international exchange of coconut germplasm.

AB Freezing technique is a very useful method for food preservation, although it sometimes produces damages in the product. The distribution of temperatures of raw potato was measured during the freezing operation by using an infrared thermographic camera Thermal Imager Optris PI160. Moreover, volume, moisture and water activity were measured before and after the freezing process. Cryo-SEM was also used to analyze the microstructure of fresh, frozen and thawed potato. The dielectric spectra of potato samples were measured before freezing and after defreeze, using an Agilent 85070E Open-ended Coaxial Probe connected to a network analyzer Agilent E8362B in the frequency range from 500 MHz to 20 GHz. The aim of this work was to monitor the temperature of potato surface during the freezing operation and to determine the water chemical potential and the structural changes of potato during this process, in order to determine the water motion throughout the freezing. The results showed important relations between the heat flux, water chemical potential gradients and structural changes. The paper demonstrated that infrared thermography and dielectric properties can be considered very important nondestructive tools for monitoring the freezing process of potato.
   Industrial relevance: The results of this research article are demonstrated to be useful for describing the freezing process of raw potato. Thus, the industrial relevance is clear because two nondestructive techniques have been used for this purpose: infrared thermography and dielectric properties. On the other hand, a microstructural study of fresh, frozen and thawed potato has been made. For all these reasons we are sending to this journal "Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies" our results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A rapid method for multi-residue determination of pesticides in agricultural products was validated. The sample was cut into pieces and placed into a mixer cup containing half weight amount of 10% phosphoric acid in order to suppress degradation of easily degraded pesticides, represented by captan, and then homogenized. Pesticides in the phosphoric acid-treated sample were extracted with acetonitrile using a homogenizer, followed by salting out with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and 'sodium chloride. The extract was cleaned up on a C18 and graphite carbon black/PSA mini-cartridge column. Some pesticides gave tailing peaks, but these peaks became sharp and symmetrical when polyethylene glycol (PEG) 300 was added to the test solution. Recovery tests were performed on nine kinds of agricultural products (brown rice, soybean, spinach, cabbage, potato, orange, apple, strawberry, and Japanese pear) fortified with 170 pesticides at 0.01 and 0.1 mu g/g. Each concentration of pesticide residue was extracted from 2 samples on 5 separate days. The trueness of the method for 147-164 pesticides in each sample was 70-120% with satisfactory repeatability and within-run reproducibility. This method is expected to useful for multi-residue analysis of pesticides in agricultural products.

AB A leaf spot and leaf blight disease was observed on Aloe vera plants as small, circular to oval dark brown necrotic sunken spots on leaves. Infected tissues collected from different sites in diseased fields were cultured on potato carrot agar medium, and the pathogen was identified as Alternaria alternata on the basis of morphological and cultural characteristics. The conidiophores were branched, straight, golden brown, smooth-walled, measuring up to mu m long by 3 mu m wide with one conidial scar. The conidia were golden brown in colour and produced in long branched chains, obclavate in shape and in short conical flask. Pathogenicity tests conducted on healthy potted aloe plants in a glasshouse showed typical leaf spot symptoms after 4-7 days. The optimal temperature for the growth of A. alternata was 25 degrees C.

AB The effect of nitrogen fertilization and microbial preparations on yielding and development of potato tuber yield components were assessed in field experiments conducted under soil conditions of Luvic Chernozem. The factors of the experiment were nitrogen fertilization levels: 0, 60, 120 and 180 kg N/ha and the following preparations: BactoFil B10, effective microorganisms and UG(max) soil fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilization caused a significant increase in marketable yield of potato tubers. Yield increments on individual fertilizer treatments ranged from 66% to 140%. An evident effect of this factor was also visible regarding the yield components values. Increase in the number of main stems per 1 m(2) under the influence of growing nitrogen doses occurred from the fertilization level 120 kg N/ha, whereas the number of tubers per 1 stem increased only to the level of 60 kg N/ha. Each nitrogen dose applied within the range to 180 kg N/ha caused a marked increase in an average tuber weight. Conducted investigations demonstrated an unfavourable effect of microbial preparations on the marketable crop yield of tubers and formation of yield components. On the objects where microbial preparations were applied, the marketable yield was lower by 1.5 to 2.3 t/ha than in the control. Analysis of linear regression revealed occurrence of significant dependencies between the total tuber yield and the values of individual yield components. The relationships were the most visible for an average tuber weight formation as evidenced by the value of coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.983).

AB Laboratory toxicity tests are a key component of the aquatic risk assessments of chemicals. Toxicity tests with Myriophyllum spicatum are conducted based on working procedures that provide detailed instructions on how to set up the experiment, e.g., which experimental design is necessary to get reproducible and thus comparable results. Approved working procedures are established by analyzing numerous toxicity tests to find a compromise between practical reasons (e.g., acceptable ranges of ambient conditions as they cannot be kept completely constant) and the ability for detecting growth alterations. However, the benefit of each step of a working procedure, e.g., the random repositioning of test beakers, cannot be exactly quantified, although this information might be useful to evaluate working procedures. In this paper, a growth model of M. spicatum was developed and used to assess the impact of temperature and light fluctuations within the standardized setup. It was analyzed how important it is to randomly reassign the location of each plant during laboratory tests to keep differences between the relative growth rates of individual plants low. Moreover, two examples are presented on how modeling can give insight into toxicity testing. Results showed that randomly repositioning of individual plants during an experiment can compensate for fluctuations of light and temperature. A method is presented on how models can be used to improve experimental designs and to quantify their benefits by predicting growth responses.

ID CROP IMPROVEMENT; HISTORY
AB Participatory Plant Breeding (PPB) is mostly considered relevant to smallholder agriculture in developing countries. PPB involves getting farmers to participate in plant breeding to overcome shortcomings in the formal plant breeding system. The potato breeding system in the Netherlands has a long standing tradition of farmer participation in breeding. This PPB differs from the 'standard' PPB model as there is substantial private sector involvement and the system is situated in a modern, western context. Since its inception, farmer-breeders have contributed substantially to developing this potato breeding system, which supplies a large diversity of crop varieties that are grown in very varied environmental conditions around the world and for different consumer markets. This paper describes the current organizational structure and practices, provides some historical background and analyses the functions, relations and interactions of the major actors in the system. It argues that a historically international and commercially orientated potato sector was able to prosper because of a supportive political and legal context, which provided public institutional support to private sector potato breeding activities. Farmers' knowledge and skills are particularly well expressed and vital in breeding in potato-a very heterogeneous and vegetatively-propagated crop. A new PPB initiative called BioImpuls recently emerged and engages organic potato farmers in a search to develop late blight-resistant varieties for the organic sector. This supports the argument that farmers' knowledge can substantially contribute to modern and diversified breeding. While Dutch potato breeding is a special case in various respects, our analysis identifies several key attributes which could inform the design of successful PPB programmes in developing countries.

AB Oomycetes are filamentous organisms that cause notorious diseases, several of which have a high economic impact. Well known is Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of potato late blight. Previously, in silico analyses of the genome and transcriptome of P. infestans resulted in the annotation of a large number of genes encoding proteins with an N-terminal signal peptide. This set is collectively referred to as the secretome and comprises proteins involved in, for example, cell wall growth and modification, proteolytic processes, and the promotion of successful invasion of plant cells. So far, proteomic profiling in oomycetes was primarily focused on subcellular, intracellular or cell wall fractions; the extracellular proteome has not been studied systematically. Here we present the first comprehensive characterization of the in vivo secretome and extracellular proteome of P. infestans. We have used mass spectrometry to analyze P. infestans proteins present in seven different growth media with mycelial cultures and this resulted in the consistent identification of over two hundred proteins. Gene ontology classification pinpointed proteins involved in cell wall modifications, pathogenesis, defense responses, and proteolytic processes. Moreover, we found members of the RXLR and CRN effector families as well as several proteins lacking an obvious signal peptide. The latter were confirmed to be bona fide extracellular proteins and this suggests that, similar to other organisms, oomycetes exploit non-conventional secretion mechanisms to transfer certain proteins to the extracellular environment.

AB Meloidogyne species pose a significant threat to crop production in Africa due to the losses they cause in a wide range of agricultural crops. The direct and indirect damage caused by various Meloidogyne species results in delayed maturity, toppling, reduced yields and quality of crop produce, high costs of production and therefore loss of income. In addition, emergence of resistance-breaking Meloidogyne species has partly rendered various pest management programmes already in place ineffective, therefore putting food security of the continent at risk. It is likely that more losses may be experienced in the future due to the on-going withdrawal of nematicides. To adequately address the threat of Meloidogyne species in Africa, an accurate assessment and understanding of the species present, genetic diversity, population structure, parasitism mechanisms and how each of these factors contribute to the overall threat posed by Meloidogyne species is important. Thus, the ability to accurately characterize and identify Meloidogyne species is crucial if the threat of Meloidogyne species to crop production in Africa is to be effectively tackled. This review discusses the use of traditional versus molecular-based identification methods of Meloidogyne species and how accurate identification using a polyphasic approach can negate the eminent threat of root knot nematodes in crop production. The potential threat to Africa posed by highly damaging and resistance-breaking populations of 'emerging' Meloidogyne species is also examined.

AB Bacterial soft rot is a globally significant plant disease that causes major losses in the production of many popular crops, such as potato. Little is known about the dispersal and ecology of soft-rot enterobacteria, and few animals have been identified as vectors for these pathogens. This study investigates whether soil-living and bacterial-feeding nematodes could act as vectors for the dispersal of soft-rot enterobacteria to plants. Soft-rot enterobacteria associated with nematodes were quantified and visualized through bacterial enumeration, GFP-tagging, and confocal and electron scanning microscopy. Soft-rot enterobacteria were able to withstand nematode grazing, colonize the gut of Caenorhabditis elegans and subsequently disperse to plant material while remaining virulent. Two nematode species were also isolated from a rotten potato sample obtained from a potato storage facility in Finland. Furthermore, one of these isolates ( Pristionchus sp. FIN-1) was shown to be able to disperse soft-rot enterobacteria to plant material. The interaction of nematodes and soft-rot enterobacteria seems to be more mutualistic rather than pathogenic, but more research is needed to explain how soft-rot enterobacteria remain viable inside nematodes.

AB Nine bacteriophages infecting Dickeya spp. biovar 3 ('Dickeya solani') were isolated from soil samples collected in different regions in Poland. The phages have a typical morphology of the members of the order Caudovirales, family Myoviridae, with a head diameter of c. 90-100 nm and tail length of c. 120-140 nm. In host range experiments, phage phi D5 expressed the broadest host range, infecting members of all Dickeya spp., and phage phi D7 showed the narrowest host range, infecting isolates of Dickeya dadantii and 'D. solani' only. None of the phages was able to infect Pectobacterium spp. isolates. All phages were prone to inactivation by pH 2, temperature of 85 C and by UV illumination for 10 min (50 mJ cm(-2)). Additionally, phages phi D1, phi D10 and phi D11 were inactivated by 5 M NaCl and phage phi D2 was inactivated by chloroform. Phages phi D1, phi D5, phi D7 and phi D10 were characterized for optimal multiplicity of infection and the rate of adsorption to the bacterial cells. The latent period was 30 min for phi D1, 40 min for phi D5, 20-30 min for phi D7 and 40 min for phi D10. The estimated burst size was c. 100 plaque-forming units per infected cell. The bacteriophages were able to completely stop the growth of 'D. solani' in vitro and to protect potato tuber tissue from maceration caused by the bacteria. The potential use of bacteriophages for the biocontrol of biovar 3 Dickeya spp. in potato is discussed.

AB Carrot psyllid Trioza apicalis was recently found to carry the plant pathogenic bacterium 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (CLs). To confirm the transmission of bacteria by the psyllids and to dissect the symptoms caused in carrot plants by psyllid feeding and CLs infection, a greenhouse experiment with single psyllids feeding on separate plants was performed. A positive correlation was found between the amount of CLs bacteria in the psyllids and in the corresponding plants exposed to feeding, indicating CLs transmission. The female psyllid feeding caused more severe damage than male feeding, and resulted in a substantial decrease in the root weight. Female psyllid feeding also significantly reduced the carrot leaf weight and increased the number of curled leaves. The number of curled leaves was also increased by the nymphs when their number exceeded 10 per plant. A high titre of CLs bacteria significantly reduced root weight, while not affecting the weight or number of the leaves. However, the amount of CLs correlated with the number of leaves showing discolouration symptoms. Microscopy of infected carrot plants revealed that the phloem tubes throughout the whole plant, from leaf veins to the root tip, were colonized by bacteria. The bacterial cells appeared to be long and thin flexible rods with tapering ends and a transversally undulated surface. Microscopy also revealed collapsed phloem cells in the infected carrots. Damage in the phloem vessels is likely to reduce the sucrose transport from source leaves to the root, explaining the observed leaf discolouration and reduction in root weight.

AB To diminish the time required for some diagnostic assays including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP; due to mainly DNA extraction step) and also triple antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (TAS-ELISA) into a minimum level, an innovative immunocapture LAMP (IC-LAMP) and immunocapture PCR (IC-PCR) protocol on the basis of beet curly top virus (BCTV) genome was used and optimized. TAS-ELISA was employed first to validate the existence of the virus. All six IC-LAMP primers (i.e. forward outer primer (F3), backward outer primer (B3), forward inner primer (FIP), backward inner primer (BIP), loop forward (LF) and loop backward (LB)) together with IC-PCR primers were designed on the basis of the replication-associated protein (rep) gene (GenBank accession AF379637.1) of BCTV genome. Also, a novel colorimetric IC-LAMP assay for rapid and easy detection of BCTV was developed here, its potential compared with TAS-ELISA and IC-PCR assays. The method, on the whole, had the following advantages over the two mentioned procedures: (i) fascinatingly, no need of DNA extraction; (ii) no requirement of expensive and sophisticated tools for amplification and detection; (iii) no post-amplification treatment of the amplicons and (iv) a flexible and easy detection approach, which is visually detected by naked eyes using diverse visual dyes.

AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) process is a well-established method to generate energy from the organic wastes both from the environmental and economical perspectives. The purpose of present study is to evaluate energy production from potato wastes by incorporating cow manure into the process. Firstly, a laboratory pilot of one-stage biogas production was designed and built according to continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system. The setup was able to automatically control the environmental conditions of the process including temperature, duration, and rate of stirring. AD experiment was exclusively performed on co-digestion of potato peel (PP) and cow manure (CM) in three levels of mixing ratio including 20:80, 50:50, 80:20 (PP:CM), and 0:100 as control treatment based on the volatile solid (VS) weight without adding initial inoculums. After hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 50 days on average 193, 256, 348, and 149 norm liter (L-N) (kg VS)(-1), methane was produced for different mixing ratios, respectively. Statistical analysis shows that these gas productions are significantly different. The average energy was determined based on the produced methane which was about 2.8 kWh (kg VS)(-1), implying a significant energy production potential. The average chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of treatments was about 61 %, showing that it can be leached significantly with high organic matter by the employed pilot. The energy efficiency of 92 % of the process also showed the optimum control of the process by the pilot.

AB Both the sex ratio and the extent of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) can have important implications for the mating system of a species. In particular, the sex that is limited (generally the female) is often the subject of intense competition, which can drive changes in behaviour and morphology to increase the competitive ability of the more abundant sex. The New Zealand giraffe weevil, Lasiorhynchus barbicornis (Fabricius, 1775), is a large and charismatic species found across much of New Zealand, but very little is known about its natural history. We determined the population structure and ecology of L. barbicornis from a single wild population over 3 years. L. barbicornis was found to be highly abundant in the warmer months, between November and May, but showed a peak in abundance in February and March in each year. The sex ratio was consistently male-biased throughout the breeding season (mean sex ratio between seasons 0.59 +/- 0.02). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that L. barbicornis is highly sexually size-dimorphic mostly because of the extreme elongation of the rostrum of the male. All body parts of the males were also found to be more variable in size than those of the females, particularly head length, as shown by higher coefficients of variation. There was, however, no significant seasonal variation in SSD. These data are crucial to gain an understanding of the ecology and of factors driving the mating system in this species. The male-biased sex ratio and SSD are key components of L. barbicornis ecology and are likely to have driven the highly competitive, defence-based mating system observed.

AB End-functionalized macromolecular starch reagents, prepared by reductive amination, were grafted onto a urethane-linked polyester-based backbone using copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) chemistry to produce novel amphiphilic hybrid graft copolymers. These copolymers represent the first examples of materials where the pendant chains derived from starch biopolymers have been incorporated into a host polymer by a grafting-to approach. The graft copolymers were prepared in good yields (63-90%) with high grafting efficiencies (66-98%). Rigorous quantitative spectroscopic analyses of both the macromolecular building blocks and the final graft copolymers provide a comprehensive analytical toolbox for deciphering the reaction chemistry. Due to the modular nature of both the urethane-linked polyester synthesis and the postpolymerization modification, the starch content of these novel hybrid graft copolymers was easily tuned from 28-53% (w/w). The uptake of two low molecular weight guest molecules into the hybrid polymer thin films was also studied. It was found that binding of 1-naphthol and pterostilbene correlated linearly with amount of starch present in the hybrid polymer. The newly synthesized graft copolymers were highly processable and thermally stable, therefore, opening up significant opportunities in film and coating applications. These results represent a proof-of-concept system for not only the construction of starch-containing copolymers, but also the loading of these novel polymeric materials with active agents.

AB Cervical auscultation is a noninvasive technique for the exploration of swallowing and has been used since the 1960s. The aim of our study was to describe how the volume and consistency of the bolus affect swallowing acoustic sound characteristics in healthy subjects. Twenty-three subjects aged from 20 to 59 years were included (13 women and 10 men). A microphone mounted on a stethoscope chest piece, positioned on the skin on the right side in front of the posteroinferior border of the cricoid cartilage, was used; it was connected to a computer for acoustic recordings. Each subject swallowed 2-, 5-, and 10-ml aliquots of water, yogurt, and mashed potato. Each bolus was administered once, with a period of at least 30 s between each swallow. For each recorded sound, the total duration of the sound and the duration of each sound component (SC) (SC1, SC2, and SC3) and interval (IT1 and IT2) between the SCs were measured. For all records, the average duration of acoustic measures was calculated. Differences according to the volume and the consistency of the swallowed bolus were assessed using Student's t test for paired data. We calculated the percentage of recordings that included each SC. We also compared results between men and women using Student's t test. We successfully interpreted 540 of the 621 (87 %) records. The results indicated that the average total duration of the sound, and especially the average duration of SC2, increased with increasing volume and was greater for mashed potato than for the boluses of other consistencies. SC2 was present in all of the records.

AB Optimization of processing conditions (temperature 122 to 136A degrees C, vacuum pressure 9.91 to 19.91 cmHg, and frying time 3 to 9 min) during vacuum frying of plantain chips was investigated using a Box-Behnken experimental design with response surface methodology (RSM). Models for various responses were developed and optimized frying conditions using numerical solutions were established. Optimized vacuum fried samples were compared with atmospheric fried samples based on the concept of equivalent thermal driving force (ETDF). Frying parameters had significant (p < 0.05) effects on the moisture content, texture, and color with a coefficient of determination (R (2)) for quadratic model responses varying between 0.53 and 0.99. Optimum vacuum frying conditions for plantain chips were a frying temperature of 133A degrees C, vacuum pressure of 9.91 cmHg, and frying time of 6 min based on desirability concepts. Vacuum fried plantain chips had more acceptable sensory properties, based on ETDF values, than atmospheric fried samples.

AB Purple sweet potato makgeolli vinegar made using a 2-stage fermentation method was evaluated. The highest alcohol concentration was 4% in a growth medium containing Acetobacter aceti ATCC 15973. Purple sweet potato makgeolli vinegar (PMV) had higher pH and lower acidity values than rice makgeolli vinegar (RMV). The total polyphenol content was 327.14 mg of GAE/L and the DPPH radical scavenging activity was 67.63% for PMV. Both values were much higher than for RMV. The total polyphenol and the DPPH radical scavenging activities of PMV decreased slowly during storage for 20 days, showing that stability of the antioxidant effect during storage was maintained.

AB The peach potato aphid, Myzus persicae is a globally distributed crop pest with a host range of over 400 species including many economically important crop plants. The intensive use of insecticides to control this species over many years has led to populations that are now resistant to several classes of insecticide. Work spanning over 40 years has shown that M. persicae has a remarkable ability to evolve mechanisms that avoid or overcome the toxic effect of insecticides with at least seven independent mechanisms of resistance described in this species to date. The array of novel resistance mechanisms, including several 'first examples', that have evolved in this species represents an important case study for the evolution of insecticide resistance and also rapid adaptive change in insects more generally. In this review we summarise the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying resistance in M. persicae and the insights study of this topic has provided on how resistance evolves, the selectivity of insecticides, and the link between resistance and host plant adaptation.

AB The aim of the present study is to determine the influence of serial modifications, including retrogradation followed by acetylation on morphological, physicochemical and drug release properties of retrograded Indian palmyrah (Borassus flabellifer L.) shoot starch. The acetylated retrograded starches prepared by using different concentrations of acetic anhydride were shown a degree of substitution (DS) in the range of 0.16-0.55. Acetylation of retrograded starch produced significant morphological changes from rough to smooth surface. The amylose content, water holding capacity, swelling and solubility power tend to increase with increase in DS. A strong peak at 1751 and 1032 cm(-1) confirms the formation of acetylated retrograded starch. The TGA data reveal that with increase in DS there is an increased thermal stability and decreased bound water of starch. The elemental analysis also confirms the addition of acetyl groups because of increased carbon and hydrogen content. The matrix tablets of acetylated retrograded starch with high DS showed a delayed release in gastric pH and sustained release in simulated intestinal fluid. Overall, this result suggested that acetylated retrograded starch with high DS are thermally stable and can be used for formulating protein and peptide drugs for colon targeting.

AB This article addresses ego depletion as a mechanism influencing media-based stress recovery processes. Using structural equation modeling, relationships between ego depletion, procrastination, guilt, enjoyment, vitality, and recovery experience were tested using data from an online survey (N= 471). Results suggest that ego depletion may increase the risk of negatively appraising the use of interactive (video games) and noninteractive (television) entertaining media as a form of procrastination. The resulting guilt is negatively related to the recovery experience associated with using entertainment. Therefore, ego-depleted individuals may benefit less from the psychological recovery potential of entertainment media, despite their greater need for recovery. These findings are an important step in understanding the pivotal role of appraisal processes for media-induced recovery and the entertainment experience.

AB We report on the synthesis of spherical, well-dispersed colloidal gold nanoparticles of 17.5-23.5 nm average sizes in water using potato extract (PE) both as reducing and stabilizing agent. The effects of PE content and the pH value of the reaction mixture have been studied. Formation and growth dynamics of the Au nanoparticles in the colloids were studied using transmission electron microscopy and UV-Vis optical absorption spectroscopy techniques. While the reductor content and, hence, the nucleation and growth rates of the nanoparticles could be controlled by controlling the PE content in the reaction solution, the stability of the nanoparticles depended strongly on the pH of the reaction mixture. The mechanisms of Au ion reduction and stabilization of Au nanoparticles by potato starch have been discussed. The use of common natural solvent like water and biological reductor like PE in our synthesis process opens up the possibility of synthesizing Au nanoparticles in fully green (environmental friendly) way, and the Au nanoparticles produced in such way should have good biocompatibility.

AB The aim of this study was to monitor the effects of gamma irradiation and storage on the content of lutein and zeaxanthin in egg yolk samples. Liquid, frozen and dried egg samples were subjected to gamma irradiation doses of 0, 1, 2 and 3 kGy followed by storage of liquid samples at + 4 +/- 1 degrees C for 21 days, frozen samples at -18 +/- 1 degrees C and dried samples at room temperature for 1 year. The xanthophyll concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector. It was observed that concentrations of both lutein and zeaxanthin were decreased significantly (P<0.05) after irradiation and during storage. The mechanism for radiation-induced degradation was proposed as radical formation which initiate chain reactions. It was suggested that during storage active radical species and oxygen caused the degradation.

AB Globally, pressure on concentrate feed resources is increasing, especially in the tropics where many countries are net importers of food. Forage plants are a possible alternative, but their use as feed ingredients for pigs raises several issues related to their higher fibre and plant secondary metabolites contents as well as their lower nutritive value. In this paper, the nutritive value of several forage species and the parameters that influence this nutritive value in relationship to the plant family, the physiological stage, the plant part and the preservation method (fresh, hay and silage) are reviewed. The influence of the breed and the physiological status of the animal on animal voluntary intake of fibre-rich ingredients, digestibility as related to gastrointestinal volume and transit time and growth performances are also discussed. The final section highlights the advantages and drawbacks of forage plants in pig diets and stresses the need for proper economic evaluation to conclude on the benefits of the use of forage plants in pig feed.

AB Dehydration and subsequent storage of food materials may result in physicochemical changes and losses of bioactive substances. The purpose of the present study was to determine the stability and loss kinetics of carotenoids in dehydrated emulsions, and to compare the ability of freeze dried single-layer (SL) and layer-by-layer (LBL) emulsions with trehalose as wall material to protect the carotenoids. WPI (2%, w/w, in oil) was used as an emulsifier and homogenised with sunflower oil containing beta-carotene (0.05%, w/w) and lutein (0.05%, w/w). Gum Arabic was added to obtain LBL emulsion. Trehalose (20%, w/w) was used as the wall material. Citric acid solution (10%, w/w) was used to adjust the pH of emulsions to pH 3.5. The emulsions were then freeze-dried, humidified at 33% RH, stored at low oxygen (25 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 45 degrees C) in closed containers, and analysed using HPLC with C30 column and photodiode-array detector. The loss of lutein and all-trans-beta-carotene followed first order kinetics and was more rapid in the SL system compared to the LBL system. Carotenoid losses increased with increasing storage temperatures especially in the SL systems. The activation energy of all-trans-beta-carotene in SL was 62.1 kJ/mol compared to 43.9 kJ/mol in LBL and 58.9 kJ/mol in SL compared to LBL with 45.9 kJ/mol for lutein. The total beta-carotene retention upon storage for 70 days was higher in LBL at all storage temperatures. However, the utilisation of LBL increased isomerisation. LBL gave better protection towards carotenoid losses during storage and is highly applicable to formulated materials to control the stability of oil soluble bioactive components.

AB The influence of egg yolk (EY) or yolk plasma addition on the rheological properties and flavour characteristics of heat-set gels based on whey protein isolate (WPI) was the objective of this study. Large deformation compression tests and small deformation oscillatory measurements have shown that WPI gel structure-strengthening may take place following the incorporation of either EY or yolk plasma, indicating a possible synergistic effect between the yolk constituents on one hand and those of WPI on the other. Headspace solid-phase micro extraction technique, coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, was applied to characterise the volatile compounds of the gels. A total of 29 compounds were identified. Furthermore, GC-Olfactometry analysis revealed that the major contributors to the overall odour quality of the mixed gels were 2,3-butanedione (buttery, caramel-like odour), hexanal (green), heptanal (fishy), 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (cooked/milky), 1-hexanol (cooked) and methional (boiled potato-like odour), compounds originating either from WPI or EY.

AB Designing food items with high satiating capacity is an area of increasing interest. It would be desirable for consumers to be able to make informed choices about individual products based on understanding the energy balance and the meaning of satiety.
   In the present work, the perceptions that consumers have of the word "satiating" and of different protein-based dishes were investigated in two populations (100 subjects related to the field of food science and technology and 100 unrelated to it). The Word Association (WA) technique was used, asking the consumers for the first four words that came into their mind when they thought of "satiating food". This was followed by a Free Listing (FL) exercise that asked them to list four satiating food items, They also completed a Nutritional Knowledge Questionnaire. To evaluate the consumers' perception of the expected satiating capacity of different protein-based meals, they were shown eight photographs of equicaloric dishes composed of one piece of protein (beef, pork, chicken or fish) and one of two different side vegetables (salad or boiled potatoes). The expected satiety scores ranked fish last among the protein foods and potatoes last among the side vegetables. The results indicated that "satiating" food was related more with the immediate sensation of "stomach full" than with the cessation of hunger. This was reinforced by the mention of negative sensations of discomfort after a copious meal. Hearty dishes and meat were the meals most associated with satiating food items. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There are drawbacks for the decision tree strategies recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) (FAO/WHO, 2001) in allergenicity assessment. In this study, we evaluated the allergenic activity of glycinin (Gly), ovalbumin (OVA) and potato acid phosphatase (PAP) by using an RBL cell-based immunological assay and the decision tree strategies. We then further analyzed the complementary applications between the RBL cell-based immunological assay and the decision tree strategies. A bioinformatical analysis predicted that the ranking of potential allergenicity was Gly > OVA > PAP, which was determined by analyzing the linear-epitope regions. However, the RBL cell-based immunological assay can determine the ability of the linear and conformational epitopes to induce allergic reactions. A pepsin digestion assay indicated that Gly was more stable compared with OVA and that PAP had no stability in simulated gastric fluid. However, this approach cannot fully reflect the results of food proteins digested in the gastrointestinal tract. Anaphylactic reactions in Balb/c mice and optimal beta-hexosaminidase release of RBL-2H3 cells were induced with Gly followed by OVA; no significant response and < 10% release were obtained with PAP. Compared with the animal models, the RBL cell-based immunological assay is more suitable for evaluating the allergenic activity of food proteins based on the simple characteristics of the testing system. The RBL cell-based immunological assay may play a "referee" role when inconsistent results between a bioinformatical analysis and a pepsin digestion assay occur, and animal models may be used to further dissect the mechanisms of the allergic responses. Thus complementary applications between the RBL cell-based immunological assay and the decision tree strategies will be a good choice to conduct a complete evaluation of the allergenic potential of foods.

AB Extra virgin olive, soybean and sunflower oils were used in three different series of fourteen experiments to deep-fry three foods of very different lipidic content and composition. The aim of this study was toanalyze how much the composition of the frying medium influenced the lipidic composition of the fried food. To achieve this, the compositions both of the frying medium throughout fourteen deep-frying experiments carried out with each kind of oil, as well as that of the unfried food were studied by H-1 NMR. This same technique was used to study the lipidic composition of each fried food. The study focussed on the changes in the molar percentage of the different kinds of acyl groups, sterols and diglycerides as well as on the occurrence of compounds or functional groups coming from lipid degradation, such as aldehydes, epoxy groups and primary and secondary alcohols, all of them determined from H-1 NMR spectral data.

AB A new gamasid mite belonging to the genus Arctoseius Thor, 1930 is described from Slovakia. The illustrated description of Arctoseius cellaris sp. nov. is based on females collected in a root cellar built underground and used to store potatoes, turnips and other root crops. The new species has a two-tined epistome, shortened peritremes, sternal shield lacking endopodal fragments and smooth idiosomal shields without a clear reticulate pattern, which is closely related to species of the cetratus group. That group is redefined to accommodate the new species, and an updated identification key to its known members is provided.

AB The properties of Jxsac 2, a new polysaccharide from potato starch with low cost, were characterized to determine its physico-chemical, morphological, pasting and thermal properties, and in vitro digestibility. Results showed that Jxsac 2 is produced from starch with limited degradation. There were three peaks in the high-performance size exclusion chromatography, and the average molecular weight of this polysaccharide was 9,676 D. Jxsac 2 has high rapidly digestible starch content (87.06%), while the resistant starch content is 12.94%. The polysaccharide had medium molecular weight, which might supply energy rapidly and maintain blood glucose level. Jxsac 2 could be a potential ingredient for the industrial application in high-energy sports drinks and solid beverages.

AB In this study, a Box-Behnken design was carried out in order to study the effects of coating agent (locust bean gum [LBG]) concentration (0-1%), frying time (30-120 s) and frying temperature (160-190C) on oil content, moisture content and volume of fried potato chips. The fitted mathematical model allowed us to plot isoresponse curves and to determine optimal coating and frying conditions. Results showed that frying temperature was the main factor influencing the oil uptake of potato chips. High-quality potato chips characterized by a low fat content (<%), a moisture content in the range of 5-7% and an acceptable volume (>10 10(-6) m(3)) could be obtained by using a LBG concentration of 1% and low frying temperature (<180C). Optimal coating and frying conditions were achieved with 1% LBG concentration, 120 s frying time at 175C frying temperature, and observed responses coincided well with the predicted values from the response surface methodology optimization technique.

AB Deep-fat frying (DFF) is a very old process that has grown exponentially over the last years. The attainment to a high and constant quality of fried products with appropriate oil content is of considerable interest to food industry and consumers; however, the theoretical aspects of the frying process are highly complex and difficult to understand. Many efforts were done in order to optimize and control the frying process. The majority of the authors have considered the use of single-objective for the optimization. However, the simultaneous optimization of several objectives is much more realistic and desirable. In this study a multi-objective optimization for DFF of ostrich meat plates was performed. Multi-objective particle swarm optimization is used to obtain the best solutions. This problem has three objective functions that must be satisfied simultaneously. Results show a Pareto that all the points on this Pareto are the best possible solutions.

AB Digital image processing technique is a useful tool for bread texture analysis. In the current study, to improve bread features (cell wall thickness, fractal dimension, circularity, solidity, crust lightness, crumb lightness, mean cell area [MCA], cell count and density, porosity, specific loaf volume [SLV], hardness and sensory attributes), final proofing time (FPT), dough mixing time in low (MTLS; 63 rpm) and high speed (MTHS; 180 rpm) were considered as the independent variables. Result showed rising FPT up to 60 min led to significant (P <= 0.05) enhancement of SLV and MCA up to 4.62 cm(3)/g and 4.63 mm(2), respectively, and decrease in crust lightness, crumb lightness and hardness. Cell count and density were strongly affected by MTHS. Crust lightness may be presumably considered as an indicator for hardness (r = 0.767) and SLV (r = -0.843) prediction. The optimized conditions were 60-min FPT, 5.30-min MTLS and 8.05-min MTHS, which can be applied for large-scale production of bread.

AB Mathematical models were developed for the heat and mass transfer phenomena during deep-fat frying of gulab jamun, a dairy dessert popular throughout the Indian subcontinent. Size, shape, core temperature, moisture and fat contents of the product were monitored at regular intervals during 8 min of frying. The heat transfer was described using both lumped capacity model and transient heat conduction equation. As the calculated Biot number for lumped capacity model was greater than 0.1, the convective heat transfer coefficient was determined using the transient heat conduction equation as 122.34, 116.12 and 94.10 W/(m(2) K) at 135, 145 and 155C, respectively. The moisture transport was described using a partial differentiation equation analogous to the transient heat conduction. The moisture transfer coefficient, ranging from 10.41 x 10(-6) to 14.35 x 10(-6)m/s, increased linearly with frying temperature. The Lewis number declined from 0.96 to 0.54 with increasing temperature, indicating that at higher frying temperatures moisture diffusivity gained predominance over thermal diffusivity. Fat uptake of the product followed fractional conversion first-order kinetic model.

AB In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE)-thermoplastic corn starch blends containing various amounts of organomodified montmorillonite (OMMT, 0.5-3 part per hundred (phr) resins) were prepared using a twin screw extruder. A 3-wt% LDPE-grafted maleic anhydride was used as a compatibilizer. The tensile, flow and water absorption properties of all the samples were measured by means of standard methods. Intercalated structures were achieved in all the samples, based on the x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopic results. Increasing levels of clay also led to the higher gallery distance of silicate layers (i.e. 32.5-34.5 angstrom). Furthermore, increment in ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and Young's modulus (E) as well as decrement in elongation at break (epsilon(b)) were obtained with increase in clay loading. The sample containing 1 phr nanoparticles showed 20% and 63% increase in UTS and E when compared with the reference sample, respectively. However, epsilon(b) of this sample decreased by 17%. In addition, the flow property measurements indicated that as shear rate and the clay content increased, the apparent viscosity of all the samples decreased and increased, respectively. Finally, the presence of OMMT led to decrease in the melt flow index (MFI) of the samples. The MFI values also decreased with increasing the OMMT concentration. It is believed that the samples prepared in this work may biodegrade after exposure to the environment.

AB Background: Mental disorders influence diet and food consumption, but there is a lack of consistent findings. Aims: To investigate food consumption, nutrient intakes and serum metabolic biomarkers in depressive, anxiety and alcohol use disorders in comparison with the remaining from a population-based nationwide sample. Methods: The study was based on the Health 2000 Survey data of which 5504 subjects aged 30 and over (3009 women and 2495 men) were used for the analysis. Depressive disorder, anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorders were diagnosed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI). The consumption of food and beverage items, and nutrient intakes were measured with a validated food frequency questionnaire, and the concentrations of biomarkers were determined in blood samples. Results: Overall, no similar differences with both genders were found in the intakes of energy, dietary fibre or macronutrients or in biomarkers in depressive or anxiety disorders. Women suffering from depressed disorder consumed more soft drinks (P = 0.034) and women suffering from anxiety disorders consumed more oils (P = 0.001), polyunsaturated fatty acids (P = 0.001) and less potatoes (P = 0.002) than the remaining participants. Men suffering from depressive disorder consumed less sweets and chocolate (P = 0.001) and men with anxiety disorder consumed more tea (P = 0.033) compared with the remaining participants. In alcohol use disorders, the intake of carbohydrate was lower in both genders (P = 0.001 for women, P = 0.001 for men). Conclusions: A difference in the usual diet exists between individuals with alcohol use disorders and the remaining participants on a population level. No consistent difference in both genders between those with depressive or anxiety disorders and the remaining was found.

AB Context: Bellis perennis L. (Asteraceae) (common daisy) is a herbaceous perennial plant known as a traditional wound herb; it has been used for the treatment of bruises, broken bones, and wounds. Bellis perennis has also been used in the treatment of headache, common cold, stomachache, eye diseases, eczema, skin boils, gastritis, diarrhea, bleeding, rheumatism, inflammation, and infections of the upper respiratory tract in traditional medicine.
   Objective: Antitumor activities of different fractions of B. perennis flowers at different concentrations were evaluated and through bioassay-guided fractionation and isolation procedures a saponin derivative (1) was isolated from the active fraction obtained from the n-butanol extract of flowers of the title plant by column chromatography.
   Materials and methods: Antitumor activities of different fractions of B. perennis flowers at different concentrations were evaluated using Potato Disc Tumor Induction Bioassay. Structure elucidation of 1 was accomplished by spectroscopic methods [1D- and 2D-NMR, and LC-ESI(APCI)-TOF-MS(MSn)].
   Results: The present study showed the antitumor activity of fractions obtained from B. perennis flowers for the first time. The most active fraction showed 99% tumor inhibition at 3000 mg/L. An oleanane-type saponin was isolated through bioassay-guided studies.
   Discussion and conclusion: Through antitumoral bioassay-guided fractionation and isolation procedures, 1 was isolated from the active fraction of B. perennis. The detailed NMR data of compound 1 is given for the first time.

AB Carotenoids are important micronutrients and specific health benefits have been associated with the consumption of food products rich in carotenoids such as fruits and vegetables. However, given their hydrophobic character, the uptake of carotenoids from food products is generally quite low. The present review summarises recent studies on fruits and vegetables in which specific product characteristics, i.e. (micro)structural characteristics and the presence or addition of lipids, are linked to carotenoid bioaccessibility. This review can form the basis for a critical and detailed identification of parameters or conditions that are crucial in the development of fruit- and vegetable-based food products containing higher amounts of carotenoids in an absorbable form. Additionally, future research challenges in this context are identified.

AB Superoxide dismutase (SOD) in-gel activity assay with selective inhibitors (KCN and H2O2) is one of the most commonly used methods for identification of SOD isoform types, i.e., FeSOD, MnSOD or Cu/ZnSOD, and evaluation of oxidative stress response in plants. However, there are potential pitfalls that surround this assay, such as problem to detect isoforms with low activity, comigration of SOD isoforms or application of inappropriate inhibitor concentration. We propose an improved method based on the combination of in-gel analysis of SOD activity and native-PAGE immunoblotting for identification of isoforms and determination of SOD isoenzyme activity pattern in potato. Depending on cultivar and growing conditions, one MnSOD, 3 FeSOD and 5-6 Cu/ZnSOD isoforms were identified in potato leaves. The most important qualitative difference between ex vitro- and in vitro-grown plants was the presence of additional FeSOD and Cu/ZnSOD isoforms in plantlets grown in vitro. Compared with results of in-gel activity assay with selective inhibitors, new method allowed accurate identification of comigrating FeSOD and Cu/ZnSOD isoforms and two protein bands of ambiguous identities. Potato SODs were also characterized by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting and single MnSOD (23.6 kDa), three Cu/ZnSOD polypeptides (17.9, 17 and 16.3 kDa) and single FeSOD (25.1 kDa) polypeptide were detected in leaves of four examined cultivars. The difference in the number of FeSOD and Cu/ZnSOD isoforms/polypeptides between native-PAGE and SDS-PAGE immunoblots suggests that SOD proteins may have undergone post-translational modifications affecting protein mobility or existence of isoforms that differ from each other in total protein charge, but not in molecular weight.

AB Propyl 4-(2-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy) benzylamino)benzoate (ZJ0273) is a new herbicide which inhibits acetolactate synthase (ALS). The ZJ0273 is considered as safe for the environment and exhibits a satisfactory effect on weed control in the rapeseed field. ALS is the key enzyme of reactions in the biosynthesis of total amino acids (TAAs) especially branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). This study reports the effect of ZJ0273 on BCAAs and TAAs in rapeseed leaves using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) techniques. A decrease in TAAs and BCAAs contents was observed as the herbicide dosages were increased along with leaf senescence. The wavelengths 2,416 and 1,340 nm were selected to develop the NIRS model for detecting BCAAs and TAAs, and correlation coefficients of model's prediction set were 0.9823, 0.9764, 0.9831, and 0.9968 for valine, isoleucine, leucine, and TAAs, respectively. The results indicated that 100 mg/L ZJ0273 was a safe dosage for oilseed rape as it did not show a significant effect on the contents of amino acids compared to other higher dosages (500 and 1,000 mg/L).

AB Sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS, EC 2.4.1.14) refers to a key enzyme in sucrose biosynthesis in both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic tissues of plants. It is encoded by different gene families. SPS exists in multiple forms which show differential distributions and functional specializations in the plant tissues. SPS activity is highly regulated by hierarchy of mechanisms including transcriptional control. Here, we report an isolation of a cDNA clone (3,591 bp) encoding full-length SPS A form consisting of 1,054 amino acids (designated KC-SPS1) from a commercially important Indian potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivar, Kufri Chipsona-1 by RT-PCR approach from tuber total RNA. KC-SPS1 shared 99 % sequence identity with 1,053-amino acid SPS from potato cv. Desiree. Apart from some prominent amino acid substitutions, one extra Met residue at position 235 made KC-SPS1 a distinct member of SPS A family in potato. Full-length SPS sequences from taxonomically different plant species were used in making a phylogenetic tree which showed both evolutionary relatedness, and also their grouping into different SPS families. Hydropathy characters and secondary structures were predicted in various SPS forms. Sequence analyses and comparison of the SPS sequences from the Solanaceae family members revealed many distinct features within and between the SPS gene families which were not documented earlier. SPS A form-specific expression patterns were studied in the leaves and tubers of different potato cultivars based on semi-quantitative RT-PCR and protein blot analyses. SPS activities particularly in the cold-stored tubers were probably due to altered kinetic properties. This report would be useful for in-depth studies on various SPS isoforms in potato and other Solanaceae family members.

AB The effects of soil water level and soil infested or not infested with Colletotrichum coccodes were quantified and compared on Umatilla Russet potato in repeated greenhouse trials. Nitrogen levels in leaflets and tuber yield differed significantly for effect of water level but there was no effect for soil infestation in both trials. More leaflet N as measured by chlorophyll and less tuber yield occurred in the low than the medium and high soil water treatments. Number of progeny tubers was not affected by C. coccodes but numbers were significantly less for the low water level than the high water level in one trial. Root weight was significantly reduced by C. coccodes in both trials and was significantly less in the high than the low and medium soil water levels in one trial. Incidence of infected progeny tubers was significantly reduced in infested soils for the low soil water compared to the medium or high soil water levels in one trial. The effect of increasing levels of water in infested soils had large and significant increases for percentage of stem area with sclerotia in both trials. Managing soil water by not overwatering in irrigated potato fields in the presence of C. coccodes may reduce black dot severity and quantity of sclerotia that potentially can overwinter and serve as sources of infection for subsequent crops. Analyses demonstrated a potential for significant associations between plant and disease variables not evidence for cause and effect.

AB Potato Virus Y (PVY) is one of the most devastating pathogens threatening potato production worldwide. It is a RNA virus that is disseminated by aphids in a non-persistent manner. Regular application of mineral oil on potato fields is known to reduce the number of PVY-positive tubers in post-harvest testing. The mechanism of this phenomenon is not well understood, but it is hypothesized to influence the virus-vector-plant relationships. Here, we present data from greenhouse and field trials that shed light on the effect of mineral oil on local and systemic accumulation of PVYO in susceptible Shepody and Russet Burbank. The data suggests that mineral oil did not influence PVYO levels in mechanically-inoculated leaves nor tubers of plants with a secondary infection. However, a reduction in systemic PVYO levels was observed in mineral oil-treated older plants but not in younger plants, suggesting that mineral oil inhibits PVYO movement in an age-dependent manner.

AB We have evaluated and compared different methods and cultivars for the production of quality prebasic seed in potato. Two cultivation systems, aeroponics and greenhouse beds with a peat moss substrate, and three potato cultivars with different vegetative cycle, Agria, Monalisa and Zorba, were assayed. Plants in the aeroponic system showed increased growth and their vegetative cycle extended between 12 and 36 % compared to the plants cultivated in greenhouse beds. Flowering and tuberization dates, Absolute Growth Rates (AGR) during the period of 60 days after planting (DAP) and height presented a wide variation between cultivars. Zorba showed earlier flowering and tuberization, lower AGR and reached a minor height at 60 DAP. Instead the late season cultivar Agria showed later flowering and tuberization, presented higher AGR and reached an increased height at 60 DAP. The total tuber yield per plant was between 34 and 87 % higher in the aeroponic system, with a marked difference for the earlier cultivars Zorba and Monalisa. Tuber numbers increased between 60 and 80 %. Minituber production in aeroponics showed a better size distribution, with a reduction in the percentage of tubers smaller than 12 mm of between 33 and 86 %. In this soil-less culture system average tuber weight increased in Zorba and Monalisa over 60 % but was lower for Agria. Further studies are needed to optimize aeroponics system, which can be considered a high yield potato multiplication system, particularly for early or mid season potato cultivars that may produce best quality minitubers.

TI Modification of ELISA by Replacing Incubation of Microtiter Plates in an

ID LINKED-IMMUNOSORBENT-ASSAY; VIRUS; LEAFROLL
AB ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a sensitive and reliable method of plant virus detection. It is commonly used in daily research carried out by scientific institutions and laboratories working on the certification of potato tubers. The key stage in this method is a 3-4-h-long incubation of microtiter plates with IgG and with a conjugate in an incubator at a temperature of 37 A degrees C. The aim of the research was to replace this type of incubation process with a technique of mechanically shaking the plates using a shaker to induce a vibrating movement. Three durations of shaking, performed at room temperature, were adopted: 30, 60 and 90 min with two incubation periods at a temperature of 37 A degrees C: 60 and 180 min which were applied at the stage of coating the IgG plates, following addition of the conjugate. The assessment was made for three dilutions of lyophilized sap from leaf of potatoes (1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000). Replacing the stages of plates incubation with IgG and conjugate at 37 A degrees C with mechanical shaking allowed the whole process of DAS-ELISA to be reduced below 3-4 h without any significant impact on its quality. The process turned out to be equally efficient as the 3-h-long incubation in an incubator for PVY, PVM and PLRV detection by means of DAS ELISA. Applying the 90-min-long incubation on a shaker in comparison to a 3-h-long incubation in an incubator gave comparable or even slightly improved results. The reaction background, i.e. the value of absorbance for sap from healthy plants (negative control) was very low in all the combinations irrespective of the time of reading after the substrate was placed. No significant differences for this parameter were found between the combinations and times of reading. Only in the case of PLRV was a clearly visible decrease in test sensitivity found (no positive reactions) at diluted sap over 1:10. Moreover, it was observed that an increase in dilutions impacted the length of reaction. The dilution 1:10 seemed to be the most favorable (maximum 1:100 for PVY and PVM), wherein the sensitivity and pace of staining the substrate for each of the methods did not provoke any doubts regarding the reliability of the test.

AB The characterization of resistance of selected potato, Solanum tuberosum L., breeding clones to the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc) (Hemiptera: Triozidae) was investigated. Antixenosis was assessed in choice tests in which a single plant of each genotype was placed inside a rearing cage, where 60 female psyllid adults were released and the number of adults and eggs on each genotype was counted 24 h later. Antibiosis was evaluated in no-choice tests in which adults (five males and five females) were confined in a cage fixed to the upper side of leaves. After 4 h of exposure, adults were removed and the number of eggs counted. The developmental time and survival of offspring were recorded until all insects became adults. All the resistant genotypes showed strong antibiotic effects to B. cockerelli. These results show promise for incorporation into an IPM program against B. cockerelli.

TI Selection and Validation of an AFLP Marker Core Collection for the Wild
   Potato Solanum microdontum
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POTATO RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Core; Microdontum; Genebank
ID PETOTA
AB Solanum microdontum is a diploid potato species with features that make it a good model for research into management and use of germplasm in the genebank. Its taxonomic status is unambiguous and it is in the taxonomic series of wild species closest to cultivated forms. It is represented by about 100 populations in the genebank-not too many for comprehensive evaluation, yet not too few to make prioritization of the most valuable populations worthwhile. This species is also particularly rich in desirable traits, often exhibiting very broad segregation. We here report use of DNA markers for selection of a core set of populations, and assessing whether that core captures populations with the most desirable evaluation results for economic traits. DNA was extracted from bulks of 27 plants from each of 94 populations to generate AFLPs. A total of 1,741 informative loci were detected. AFLP loci were treated as though they were traits, with the banded condition considered to be the desired state to include in a core set. At least one band unique to a population was present in 45 populations, and these 45 populations together captured 98 % of all bands. Adding another 14 populations for a core of 59 populations captured 100 % of bands. This core set was assessed for whether it encompassed those populations known to have useful traits, including nutritional and quality components; and disease, stress and pest resistances. As with AFLP bands, 25 of 26 of the most desirable phenotypic traits were also found in populations in the core set of 59 populations. The most desirable status of 3 traits is lost by selecting a core of 45 populations. We conclude that these core sets would be a rational starting point when prospecting for new useful traits in microdontum.

AB Minitubers have become important components of seed potato production systems. Minituber production methods and yields affect costs. We used data from the University of Wisconsin seed potato program to estimate minituber production costs by variety in 2009, 2010, and 2011. Labor is identified as the most significant operating cost, while salaries represent the greatest fixed cost. The 3 year average total cost per minituber across all varieties was estimated at $0.47. Of the varieties grown in all 3 years of analysis Langlade had the highest average yield and lowest cost. Yukon Gold and Pike had the lowest yields and highest costs.

AB Teton Russet is an early-maturing, medium-russeted, potato cultivar with high merit for both fresh-pack and processing. In early harvest trials in the Pacific Northwest, Teton Russet had total yields similar to Russet Norkotah, and higher than Ranger Russet and Russet Burbank. Marketable yield of Teton Russet in the early harvest trials was also comparable to or higher than Russet Norkotah in Washington and Oregon, and higher than Ranger Russet and Russet Burbank at these sites, as well as in Idaho. In full-season trials, while total yield of the earlier-maturing Teton Russet tended to be lower than Ranger Russet and Russet Burbank, marketable yield was generally higher than Russet Burbank across the majority of sites due to its higher percentage of U.S. No. 1 tubers. Teton Russet is suitable for processing, with acceptable fry color following up to 8 months of storage at 8.9 A degrees C. Uniformity of fry color was also very consistent. Teton Russet has shown lower levels of the amino acid asparagine relative to Ranger Russet and Russet Burbank which may contribute to lower acrylamide levels in French fries and other processed potato products. Teton Russet is notable for having resistance to common scab (Streptomyces spp.) and Fusarium dry rot, and is moderately resistant to tuber net necrosis. Analyses have also shown Teton Russet to have significantly higher protein levels than Russet Norkotah, Ranger Russet, and Russet Burbank, as well as higher vitamin C content than Russet Norkotah and Russet Burbank. Teton Russet was released in 2011 by the USDA-ARS and the Agricultural Experiment Stations of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, and is a product of the Pacific Northwest Potato Variety (Tri-State) Development Program.

AB Field studies were conducted in 2008 and 2009 in Aberdeen, ID, Ontario, OR, and Paterson, WA to determine the effect of simulated glyphosate drift on 'Ranger Russet' potato during the application year and the crop growing the next year from the daughter tubers. Glyphosate was applied at 8.5, 54, 107, 215, and 423 g ae ha(-1) which corresponds to 1/00, 1/16, 1/8, A1/4, and 1/2 of the lowest recommended single-application rate for glyphosate-resistant corn and sugar beet of 846 g ha(-1). Glyphosate was applied when potato plants were at 10 to 15 cm tall (Early), or at stolon hooking (H), tuber initiation (TI), or during mid-bulking (MB). In general, the MB applications caused less visual foliar injury to the mother crop than earlier applications at ID or OR, and H applications at WA. Mother crop injury increased as glyphosate rate increased regardless of location, application timing, and rating date. U.S. No.1 and total tuber yields were usually related to the injury level resulting from glyphosate application timings and rates. Although injury to the mother crop from glyphosate applied at MB usually was the lowest compared to injury from other application timings, when daughter tubers from that timing were planted the following year, emergence, plant vigor, and yield was most detrimentally impacted compared with that of daughter tubers from other timing treatments. MB daughter tuber emergence was less than 30 % of the nontreated control tuber emergence while emergence of daughter tubers from the other treatments was 60 to 95 %. As rate of glyphosate applied to the mother crop increased, daughter tuber emergence decreased. When MB daughter tubers did emerge, plants were chlorotic and stunted as if the plants had been directly sprayed with glyphosate. Regardless of whether the daughter tubers had defects or not, results the following year were the same. Implications are that if a mother seed crop encounters glyphosate during bulking, injury may not even be noticeable on the foliage or the tubers, however, emergence, vigor, and yield of the crop growing the following year from the daughter tubers could be greatly impacted.

ID YIELD STABILITY; TRIALS; TUBERS
AB Potato (Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum) cultivars are expected to express a stable level for traits important for growers and consumers. To investigate how this expectation was met by a set of 21 cultivars bred in Hungary, Poland and Spain, 2-year field experiments were carried out in these countries for the evaluation of tuber yield, starch content and yield, and occurrence of secondary growth of tubers. Stability in an agronomic sense was evaluated by the analysis of genotype by environment interaction (GE) using the Scheff,-CaliA"ski mixed model. Unstable trait expression was indicated by the statistically significant share of GE in the variability contributed by a specific cultivar. This instability could lead to either complete or partial unpredictability. Stable trait expression was observed for 6-11 cultivars, depending on the trait. A significant genetic factor, which indicates broad adaptation, was rarely found. Stable expression of tuber yield occurred together with stable or predictable expression of both starch content and yield. Unstable expressions of tuber and starch yield were also associated. The stability or instability of secondary growth was not associated with stability or instability of the other measured traits. Analysis of GE interaction was useful for identifying stable or unstable responses and revealed the presence of incomplete stability or partial unpredictability as intermediate types of reaction.

AB Verticillium dahliae Kleb. is a soilborne fungal pathogen of many crops. In potato, it is the major causal agent of Early Dying. In Manitoba, potato fields planted with cv. Russet Burbank are infested with highly pathogenic V. dahliae isolates, which can produce up to 90 % disease severity. The objective of the study was to evaluate selected compost, green manure, and seed-meal treatments, in comparison with the soil fumigant Vapam, for their ability to reduce propagule density of V. dahliae in soil and decrease disease, and to enhance potato yield. Select green manure crops (oriental and white mustard, Canada milk vetch, sorghum-sudangrass, rye, alfalfa, oat/pea mixture), organic amendments (composted cattle manure and mustard seed-meal), and Vapam, and crop sequences that contribute to the suppression of Verticillium, or the improvement of potato yield were used in a 3-year field study initiated in 2006. Survival in soil of microsclerotia was evaluated as a measure of treatments' success in potentially reducing Early Dying. Compost and seed-meal treatments, compared to an untreated control, reduced incidence to 30 and 40 %, respectively, but only seed-meal reduced V. dahliae propagule density. Overall, green manures over 1 or 2-years were ineffective in reducing propagule density or improving potato yield. Vapam was partially effective in reducing the propagule density only at the beginning of the potato season, but it did not reduce disease incidence compared to the control. Compost and seed-meal are promising as alternative control of V. dahliae. Only compost reduced disease and increased potato yield, which was associated with improved nutrient availability (phosphorus and sulfate) in soil.

AB Rhabdoviruses are taxonomically classified in the family Rhabdoviridae, order Mononegavirales. As a group, rhabdoviruses can infect plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. Plant cyto- and nucleorhabdoviruses infect a wide variety of species across both monocot and dicot families, including agriculturally important crops such as lettuce, wheat, barley, rice, maize, potato and tomato. Plant rhabdoviruses are transmitted by and replicate in hemipteran insects such as aphids (Aphididae), leafhoppers (Cicadellidae), or planthoppers (Delphacidae). These specific interactions between plants, viruses and insects offer new insights into host adaptation and molecular virus evolution. This review explores recent advances as well as knowledge gaps in understanding of replication, RNA silencing suppression and movement of plant rhabdoviruses with respect to both plant and insect hosts.

AB To investigate the genetic diversity of potato virus M (PVM; genus Carlavirus, family Betaflexiviridae), the complete nucleotide sequence of the coat protein gene of 30 PVM isolates from a major potato-growing region in Iran were determined. Phylogenetic analysis of these Iranian PVM isolates together with those available in the GenBank database suggested two divergent evolutionary lineages that did not reflect the origin of the isolates, and these were designated as PVM-o and PVM-d. Examination of the genetic variability of the coat protein of Iranian isolates and their counterparts whose sequences are available in the Genbank database revealed 16 genotype groups in the PVM population. Analysis of the synonymous-to-nonsynonymous ratio showed strong purifying selection in the CP gene in the genotype groups of divergent clades.

AB Five potato virus S (PVS) isolates from the USA and three isolates from Chile were characterized based on biological and molecular properties to delineate these PVS isolates into either ordinary (PVSO) or Andean (PVSA) strains. Five isolates - 41956, Cosimar, Galaxy, ND2492-2R, and Q1 - were considered ordinary strains, as they induced local lesions on the inoculated leaves of Chenopodium quinoa, whereas the remaining three (FL206-1D, Q3, and Q5) failed to induce symptoms. Considerable variability of symptom expression and severity was observed among these isolates when tested on additional indicator plants and potato cv. Defender. Additionally, all eight isolates were characterized by determining the nucleotide sequences of their coat protein (CP) genes. Based on their biological and genetic properties, the 41956, Cosimar, Galaxy, ND2492-2R, and Q1 isolates were identified as PVSO. PVS-FL206-1D and the two Chilean isolates (PVS-Q3 and PVS-Q5) could not be identified based on phenotype alone; however, based on sequence comparisons, PVS-FL206-1D was identified as PVSO, while Q3 and Q5 clustered with known PVSA strains. C. quinoa may not be a reliable indicator for distinguishing PVS strains. Sequences of the CP gene should be used as an additional criterion for delineating PVS strains. A global genetic analysis of known PVS sequences from GenBank was carried out to investigate nucleotide substitution, population selection, and genetic recombination and to assess the genetic diversity and evolution of PVS. A higher degree of nucleotide diversity (pi value) of the CP gene compared to that of the 11K gene suggested greater variation in the CP gene. When comparing PVSA and PVSO strains, a higher pi value was found for PVSA. Statistical tests of the neutrality hypothesis indicated a negative selection pressure on both the CP and 11K proteins of PVSO, whereas a balancing selection pressure was found on PVSA.

AB The complete nucleotide (nt) sequence of Bidens mosaic virus (BiMV) isolate SP01 was determined and shown to consist of 9,557 nt. Since it shared highest identities in the nt sequence of the whole genome (66-73 %) and in the aa sequence of the polyprotein (60-76 %) with viruses of the potato virus Y subgroup, it was compared with them genetically and biologically. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the closest relative of BiMV is sunflower chlorotic mottle virus, from which it, however, differed significantly in various respects. These results indicate that BiMV should represent a distinct species in the genus Potyvirus.

AB Tobacco bacterial wilt (TBW) is caused by Ralstonia solanacearum (R. solanacearum), a severe pathogenic agent with a wide host range. In this study, lime + ammonium bicarbonate (L + AB), organic fertilizer (OF), bio-organic fertilizer (BOF), and integrated treatment (L + AB + BOF) were assessed for the ability to control TBW and to influence the composition of native soil bacterial communities. The results showed that disease incidence of L + AB + BOF for two growth seasons in pot experiment was the lowest, with only 15.56 and 11.11 % at seasons 1 and 2, respectively. The integrated treatment could also significantly suppress TBW in the field, with a disease incidence of only 14.27 % compared with 35.41, 50.03, and 31.32 % in L + AB, OF, and BOF treatments, respectively. With application of the integrated treatment in pot and field experiments, the abundances of R. solanacearum were both significantly lower than those with other treatments. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) patterns showed that application of BOF significantly affected composition of bacterial communities of rhizosphere. The analysis of 454 sequencing data showed that application of integrated treatment recruited more beneficial bacteria than other treatments, such as Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Arthrobacter, and Streptomyces, while the abundance of Ralstonia with the integrated treatment was decreased. Overall, these results suggested that application of integrated agricultural management could effectively suppress bacterial wilt by affecting the composition of bacterial community and reducing the population of R. solanacearum.

AB A novel class of experimental fungicides has been discovered, which consists of special quinolin-6-yloxyacetamides. They are highly active against important phytopathogens, such as Phytophthora infestans (potato and tomato late blight), Mycosphaerella graminicola (wheat leaf blotch) and Uncinula necator (grape powdery mildew). Their fungicidal activity is due to their ability to inhibit fungal tubulin polymerization, leading to microtubule destabilization. An efficient synthesis route has been worked out, which allows the diverse substitution of four identified key positions across the molecular scaffold. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Proteinase inhibitors oryzacystatins I and II (OCI and OCII) have shown potential in controlling pests that utilize cysteine proteinases for protein digestion. In order to achieve an additive effect against Colorado potato beetle (CPB, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say) digestive proteinases, we combined two individual OC genes in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivars Desiree, Dragaevka and Jelica. The OC genes were stacked into the potato genome by simultaneous co-transformation with both OCI and OCII genes or by sequential re-transformation of an OCI-expressing transgenic line with an OCII gene. Low constitutive and high wound-induced transcript levels of both OCI and OCII genes, directed by the inducible pin2 promoter, were detected in all doubly transformed lines from all three cultivars. Both recombinant OCs, detected by immunoblot, were in an active conformation as shown by their strong papain inhibitory activity. Although no significant differences in CPB larval mortality were observed when larvae fed on OCI/OCII transformed or control potato foliage, expression of both OCI and OCII in potato plants caused a reduction in CPB adult body weight and in weight of foliage consumed, indicating an additive effect. Overall, these results show that pyramiding of the OCI and OCII genes could be an effective strategy for breeding cultivars exhibiting elevated levels of resistance to CPB.

AB The cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is an autotetraploid species. The complexity of tetrasomic inheritance and the lack of pure lines increase the difficulty of genetic analysis of the inherited characteristics. Tuberization is the determinant step for economic yield of potato. To understand the complex genetic basis of tuberization of the cultivated potato, we developed linkage maps for a tetraploid population (F1) of 237 genotypes and mapped QTLs for the percent of in vitro tuberized plantlets (% IVT). The paternal map for E108 (well tuberized) covered 948 cM and included 12 linkage groups, all of which contained all four homologous chromosomes. The maternal map for E20 (nontuberized) covered 1,286 cM and included 14 linkage groups, 12 of which contained all four homologous chromosomes. All 12 chromosomes of potato were tagged using the SSR markers. A major QTL (MT05) with additive effect was detected on chromosome V of E108 which explained 16.23 % of the variation for % IVT, and two minor QTLs (mt05 and mt09) displaying simplex dominant effects were located on chromosome V and chromosome IX of E20 which explained 5.33 and 4.59 % of the variation for % IVT, respectively. Based on the additive model of MT05, the segregation ratio of the gametic genotypes (Q-: qq = 5:1) matched the ratio of the tuberized genotypes to the nontuberized genotypes in the population suggesting that the segregation of in vitro tuberization in this population is controlled by a major-effect gene or genes. The mapping results of three important candidate genes indicated that the QTL causal genes detected in our study are new. In this study, we developed the almost complete linkage maps of a tetraploid population, identified a major QTL on chromosome V affecting in vitro tuberization, suggested a major-effect gene with minor modifiers model controlling this trait and found that the QTLs identified here correspond to new tuberization genes. Our work provides new and useful information about the genetic basis for tuberization of this autotetraploid crop.

AB A new species of Stemphylium causing leaf and flower blight of Platycodon grandiflorus in Korea was determined on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and morphology. Phylogenetic analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd), translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) and a combined dataset revealed that the fungus placed in a subclade distinct from the closely related Stemphylium species (S. lycopersici, S. xanthosomatis and S. subglobuliferum). The fungus morphologically differs from them by producing larger conidia and no brown pigment secreted on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Hence, the pathogenic fungus is proposed as Stemphylium platycodontis sp. nov.

AB Seventy-seven headspaceTrichoderma isolates belonging to eight species-T. atroviride, T. citrinoviride, T. hamatum, T. harzianum, T. koningii, T. viride, T. viridescens, and T. virens-were screened for their ability to produce 6-n-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PAP) and other volatiles using solid phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Intra- and interspecies variability was demonstrated in the 6-PAP synthesis. The most efficient producer of 6-PAP on potato dextrose agar (PDA) was T. atroviride. However, the variation in 6-PAP synthesis differed significantly among strains of this species, the lowest value being 33.4 mu g (strain AN212), whereas the highest reached 1,426 mu g per culture for strain AN35. Also, T. viridescens produced significant amounts of 6-PAP (200.1-526.3 mu g for 11 out of 12 strains). Moderate producers were isolates belonging to T. hamatum (up to 155 mu g) and T. citrinoviride (up to 200 mu g). Trichoderma viride isolates showed very little production of 6-PP on PDA. No 6-PAP formation was detected in cultures of 25 isolates belonging to three species, T. koningii, T. harzianum, and T. virens. Trichoderma atroviride AN35, as the most efficient producer of 6-PAP, was selected to observe the dynamics of 6-PAP formation during growth on PDA at 20 A degrees C for 6 days. A radical increase in 6-PAP production started after the fourth day of incubation, and the maximum expression was achieved in the final phase of the experiments, 6 days after inoculation. Apart from 6-PAP, over 40 other volatile compounds were detected in the survey of Trichoderma species. Among them, the most commonly produced substrates were 1-octene-3-ol, isoamyl alcohol, 3-octanone, cyclohept-3-en-1-one, 2-pentylfuran, linalol isobutyrate, toluene, D-limonene, and alpha-bergamotene. Seventeen of the detected compounds have never previously been reported as a secondary metabolite of Trichoderma.

AB The world's fourth largest food crop, potato, originates in the Andes. Here, the community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) associated with potato in Andean ecosystems is described for the first time. AMF were studied in potato roots and rhizosphere soil at four different altitudes from 2,658 to 4,075 m above mean sea level (mamsl) and in three plant growth stages (emergence, flowering, and senescence). AMF species were distinguished by sequencing an approx. 1,500 bp nuclear rDNA region. Twenty species of AMF were identified, of which 12 came from potato roots and 15 from rhizosphere soil. Seven species were found in both roots and soil. Interestingly, altitude affected species composition with the highest altitude exhibiting the greatest species diversity. The three most common colonizers of potato roots detected were Funneliformis mosseae, an unknown Claroideoglomus sp., and Rhizophagus irregularis. Notably, the potato-associated AMF diversity observed in this Andean region is much higher than that reported for potato in other ecosystems. Potato plants were colonized by diverse species from 8 of the 11 Glomeromycota families. Identification of the AMF species is important for their potential use in sustainable management practices to improve potato production in the Andean region.

AB Flux analysis has been carried out in plants for decades, but technical innovations are now enabling it to be carried out in photosynthetic tissues in a more precise fashion with respect to the number of metabolites measured. Here we describe a protocol, using gas chromatography (GC)- and liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS), to resolve intracellular fluxes of the central carbon metabolism in illuminated intact Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes using the time course of the unlabeled fractions in 40 major constituents of the metabolome after switching to (CO2)-C-13. We additionally simplify modeling assumptions, specifically to cope with the presence of multiple cellular compartments. We summarize all steps in this 8-10-week-long process, including setting up the chamber; harvesting; liquid extraction and subsequent handling of sample plant material to chemical derivatization procedures such as silylation and methoxymation (necessary for gas chromatography only); choosing instrumentation settings and evaluating the resultant chromatogram in terms of both unlabeled and labeled peaks. Furthermore, we describe how quantitative insights can be gained by estimating both benchmark and previously unknown fluxes from collected data sets.

AB Multiplicity of protease inhibitors induced by predators may increase the understanding of a plant's intelligent behavior toward environmental challenges.
   Information about defense mechanisms of non-genomic model plant passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims) in response to predator attack is still limited. Here, via biochemical approaches, we showed its flexibility to build-up a broad repertoire of potent Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors (KTIs) in response to methyl jasmonate. Seven inhibitors (20-25 kDa) were purified from exposed leaves by chromatographic techniques. Interestingly, the KTIs possessed truncated Kunitz motif in their N-terminus and some of them also presented non-consensus residues. Gelatin-Native-PAGE established multiple isoforms for each inhibitor. Significant differences regarding inhibitors' activity toward trypsin and chymotrypsin were observed, indicating functional polymorphism. Despite its rarity, two of them also inhibited papain, and such bifunctionality suggests a recruiting process onto another mechanistic class of target protease (cysteine-type). All inhibitors acted strongly on midgut proteases from sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (a lepidopteran insect) while in vivo assays supported their insecticide properties. Moreover, the bifunctional inhibitors displayed activity toward midgut proteases from cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus (a coleopteran insect). Unexpectedly, all inhibitors were highly effective against midgut proteases from Aedes aegypti a dipteran insect (vector of neglected tropical diseases) opening new avenues for plant-derived PIs for vector control-oriented research. Our results reflect the KTIs' complexities in passion fruit which could be wisely exploited by influencing plant defense conditions. Therefore, the potential of passion fruit as source of bioactive compounds with diversified biotechnological application was strengthened.

AB Expression of amylosucrase in potato resulted in larger starch granules with rough surfaces and novel physico-chemical properties, including improved freeze-thaw stability, higher end viscosity, and better enzymatic digestibility.
   Starch is a very important carbohydrate in many food and non-food applications. In planta modification of starch by genetic engineering has significant economic and environmental benefits as it makes the chemical or physical post-harvest modification obsolete. An amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea fused to a starch-binding domain (SBD) was introduced in two potato genetic backgrounds to synthesize starch granules with altered composition, and thereby to broaden starch applications. Expression of SBD-amylosucrase fusion protein in the amylose-containing potato resulted in starch granules with a rough surface, a twofold increase in median granule size, and altered physico-chemical properties including improved freeze-thaw stability, higher end viscosity, and better enzymatic digestibility. These effects are possibly a result of the physical interaction between amylosucrase and starch granules. The modified larger starches not only have great benefit to the potato starch industry by reducing losses during starch isolation, but also have an advantage in many food applications such as frozen food due to its extremely high freeze-thaw stability.

AB Smallholder agriculture in the Central Andes of Peru is based to large extent on rainfed cropping systems, is exposed to climatic risks and is expected to respond sensitively to increasing temperatures and shifts in the precipitation regime. Here, we examine the potential implications of early twenty-first century climate change scenarios for the cultivation of potato, maize, wheat, barley and broad bean, five annual crops that account for 50 % of the cultivated area in the Department of Cusco and Apurimac and provide the dietary backbone for a large share of the local population. The scenarios disclose a regionally coherent increase in temperature of the order of 1 A degrees C but overall only moderate changes in growing season precipitation by 2030. A simple crop model is used to assess the effects of these changes on crop phenology and development. The results show earlier harvest dates, shorter cropping seasons and, in a few cases, a slightly higher risk of planting failure in the near future. This suggests that a better understanding of changes in the precipitation regime at the onset of the cropping season is required to evaluate short-term needs and possibilities for adaptation. However, as the scenarios are highly uncertain, these conclusions should be verified.

AB We used a stochastic production function method together with a farm-level dataset covering 18 farms over a 23-year period to assess the role that soil and water conservation practices play in affecting the climate change impacts on potato yield in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. Our analysis accounted for the yield effects of farm inputs, farm technologies, farm-specific factors, seasonal climatic variables, soil and water conservation practices, and a series of interaction terms between soil and water conservation practices and climatic variables. Regression results were used in combination with three climate change scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (A2, A1B, B1) and four general circulation model predictions over three 30-year time periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100) to estimate a range of potato yield projections over these time periods. Results show that accounting for soil and water conservation practices in climate-yield relationships increased the impacts of climate change on potato yield, with yield increases of up to 38 % by the 2071-2100 period. These findings provide evidence that adoption of soil and water conservation practices can help boost potato production in a changing Canadian climate.

AB A simple system consisting of a suspension of 10 wt % of starch in silicone oil was subjected to electrorheological testing. The system exhibits a complex behaviour depending on the electrical field. On one hand, the application of an external electric field induced the formation of a linear structure, aligned with the electric field. The formation of that structure was studied by several rheological methods. The rate of modifying the electric field intensity resulted to be related to the electric field value at which percolation is observed. On the other hand, master curves for the structure formation and breakdown in squeeze experiments were obtained.

AB Carotenoids are bioactive compounds with remarkably special properties produced by plants in response to internal and external stresses. In this review paper, we focus on the subject of carotenoid biosynthesis and several factors that have been reported to significantly enhance or reduce carotenoid accumulation in studied plant species. These factors include varietal aspects, location, growing season, and type of stress experienced by a plant. In addition, we propose that there are three stress resistance mechanisms in plants: avoidance, tolerance, and acclimation. Better understanding of the environmental factors affecting carotenoid biosynthesis will help researchers to develop methods for enhancing the production of carotenoids and other pigments to desired concentrations in plant crops.

AB A broad range of environmental conditions likely regulate predator-prey population dynamics and impact the structure of these communities. Central to understanding the interplay between predator and prey populations and their importance is characterizing the corresponding trophic interactions. Here, we use a well-documented molecular approach to examine the structure of the community of natural enemies preying upon the squash bug, Anasa tristis, a herbivorous cucurbit pest that severely hinders organic squash and pumpkin production in the United States. Primer pairs were designed to examine the effects of organic management practices on the strength of these trophic connections and link this metric to measures of the arthropod predator complex density and diversity within an experimental open-field context. Replicated plots of butter-nut squash were randomly assigned to three treatments and were sampled throughout a growing season. Row-cover treatments had significant negative effects on squash bug and predator communities. In total, 640 predators were tested for squash bug molecular gut-content, of which 11% were found to have preyed on squash bugs, but predation varied over the season between predator groups (coccinellids, geocorids, nabids, web-building spiders and hunting spiders). Through the linking of molecular gut-content analysis to changes in diversity and abundance, these data delineate the complexity of interaction pathways on a pest that limits the profitability of organic squash production.

AB Molecular gut-content analysis enables detection of arthropod predation with minimal disruption of ecosystem processes. Most assays produce only qualitative results, with each predator testing either positive or negative for target prey remains. Nevertheless, they have yielded important insights into community processes. For example, they have confirmed the long-hypothesized role of generalist predators in retarding early-season build-up of pest populations prior to the arrival of more specialized predators and parasitoids and documented the ubiquity of secondary and intraguild predation. However, raw qualitative gut-content data cannot be used to assess the relative impact of different predator taxa on prey population dynamics: they must first be weighted by the relative detectability periods for molecular prey remains for each predator-prey combination. If this is not carried out, interpretations of predator impact will be biased towards those with the longest detectabilities. We review the challenges in determining detectability half-lives, including unstated assumptions that have often been ignored in the performance of feeding trials. We also show how detectability half-lives can be used to properly weight assay data to rank predators by their importance in prey population suppression, and how sets of half-lives can be used to test hypotheses concerning predator ecology and physiology. We use data from 32 publications, comprising 97 half-lives, to generate and test hypotheses on taxonomic differences in detectability half-lives and discuss the possible role of the detectability half-life in interpreting qPCR and next-generation sequencing data.

AB A major goal of gut-content analysis is to quantify predation rates by predators in the field, which could provide insights into the mechanisms behind ecosystem structure and function, as well as quantification of ecosystem services provided. However, percentage-positive results from molecular assays are strongly influenced by factors other than predation rate, and thus can only be reliably used to quantify predation rates under very restrictive conditions. Here, we develop two statistical approaches, one using a parametric bootstrap and the other in terms of Bayesian inference, to build upon previous techniques that use DNA decay rates to rank predators by their rate of prey consumption, by allowing a statistical assessment of confidence in the inferred ranking. To demonstrate the utility of this technique in evaluating ecological data, we test web-building spiders for predation on a primary prey item, springtails. Using these approaches we found that an orb-weaving spider consumes springtail prey at a higher rate than a syntopic sheet-weaving spider, despite occupying microhabitats where springtails are less frequently encountered. We suggest that spider-web architecture (orb web vs. sheet web) is a primary determinant of prey-consumption rates within this assemblage of predators, which demonstrates the potential influence of predator foraging behaviour on trophic web structure. We also discuss how additional assumptions can be incorporated into the same analysis to allow broader application of the technique beyond the specific example presented. We believe that such modelling techniques can greatly advance the field of molecular gut-content analysis.

AB We have increased the productivity and yield of potato (Solanum tuberosum) by developing a novel method to enhance photosynthetic carbon fixation based on expression of a polyprotein (DEFp) comprising all three subunits (D, E and F) of Escherichia coli glycolate dehydrogenase (GlcDH). The engineered polyprotein retained the functionality of the native GlcDH complex when expressed in E. coli and was able to complement mutants deficient for the D, E and F subunits. Transgenic plants accumulated DEFp in the plastids, and the recombinant protein was active in planta, reducing photorespiration and improving CO2 uptake with a significant impact on carbon metabolism. Transgenic lines with the highest DEFp levels and GlcDH activity produced significantly higher levels of glucose (5.8-fold), fructose (3.8-fold), sucrose (1.6-fold) and transitory starch (threefold), resulting in a substantial increase in shoot and leaf biomass. The higher carbohydrate levels produced in potato leaves were utilized by the sink capacity of the tubers, increasing the tuber yield by 2.3-fold. This novel approach therefore has the potential to increase the biomass and yield of diverse crops.

AB Vitamin C. B5, and B6 contents of potato tubers were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Two diploid potato populations derived from two different crosses were analyzed. Plants were grown at two locations under different environmental conditions. Measurements of vitamin content of tubers showed high variation in both populations. A weak con-elation was found between the vitamin concentrations of tubers harvested at the two locations. Correlations between the mean values of vitamins in field-grown tubers and in different tissues derived from in vitro or greenhouse-grown potato plants were also determined. A very high correlation between the vitamin content of field- and greenhouse-grown tubers, and between field-grown tubers and sink leaves of greenhouse-grown plants was detected.

AB Pollen viability and male meiosis in intraspecific hybrids of Hydrangea aspera subsp. aspera Kawakami group (2n = 2x = 36) and subsp. sargentiana (2n = 2x = 34) were investigated. Although it had been assumed that they were sterile, pollen viability was observed; it varied from 2.5% to 12.1%. The production of gametes with different chromosome numbers was implied by the analysis of the dispersion of the diameter distribution of pollen grains. Analysis of male meiosis made it possible to identify the origins with two major categories of meiotic aberrations: abnormal chromosome distribution (early chromosome migration at metaphase, lagging chromosomes at anaphase, micronuclei at telophase), leading to the formation of unbalanced tetrads and/or ones with supernumerary microspores; and abnormal spindle orientation in metaphase II (tripolar, fused and parallel spindles), leading to the formation of dyads or triads. The mode of 2n pollen formation is of the First Division Restitution type. The high level of parental heterozygosity that is normally associated with them should facilitate the transfer of a polygenic trait in breeding programme.

TI Characterization and Epidemiology of Outbreaks of Impatiens necrotic

AB California is the leading producer of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) for the United States and grows 77% of the country's supply. Prior to 2006, coastal California lettuce was only periodically and incidentally infected by a single tospoviruses species: Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). However, beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2012, severe outbreaks of disease caused by Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV) have affected the coastal lettuce crop, though TSWV was also present. In contrast, TSWV was the only tospovirus associated with disease outbreaks in Central Valley lettuce during this period. Disease surveys conducted over two seasons (2008 and 2009) in 10 commercial fields (acreage of 6 to 20 ha) indicated that INSV was the only tospovirus associated with economically damaging disease outbreaks in lettuce in the coastal region, with incidences of 0.5 to 27% (mean = 5.7%). Molecular characterization of INSV isolates associated with these disease outbreaks revealed little genetic diversity and indicated that lettuce-infecting INSV isolates were nearly identical to those previously characterized from ornamental or other hosts from different locations in the United States and the world. Monitoring of thrips revealed moderate to large populations in all surveyed lettuce fields, and the majority of thrips identified from these fields were western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis. There was significant positive correlation (r(2) = 0.91, P = 0.003) between thrips populations and INSV incidence in the most commonly encountered type of commercial lettuce (romaine, direct seeded, conventional) included in this study. A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay developed for detection of INSV in thrips showed promise as a monitoring tool in the field. Surveys for INSV reservoir hosts in the coastal production area revealed that the weeds little mallow (Malva parvifolia) and shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) were commonly infected. M. parvifolia plants infected in the field did not show obvious symptoms, whereas plants of this species inoculated in the laboratory with INSV by sap transmission developed necrotic spots and chlorosis. Eleven other weed species growing in the lettuce production areas were found to be hosts of INSV. Coastal crops found to be infected with INSV included basil (Ocimum basilicum), bell pepper (Capsicum annuum), calla lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica), faba bean (Vicia faba), radicchio (Cichorium intybus), and spinach (Spinacia oleracea). Thus, it is likely that INSV was introduced into coastal California lettuce fields via viruliferous thrips that initially acquired the virus from other local susceptible plant species. Results of this study provide a better understanding of INSV epidemiology in coastal California and may help growers devise appropriate disease management strategies.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from Phytophthora cinnamomi-infected lupin seedlings were collected by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME). The sampling was done 28 to 44, 52 to 68, and 76 to 92 h after inoculation (HAI). The HS-SPME samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) to assess the differences in volatile compounds between the P. cinnamomi infected lupin seedlings and the control. Three specific peaks were identified after 52 to 68 h with the infected lupin seedlings, at which time there were no visible aboveground symptoms of infection. Subsequently, the VOCs of five different substrates (V8A, PDA, lupin seedlings, soil, and soil + lupin seedlings) infected with P. cinnamomi and the corresponding controls were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). A total of 87 VOCs were identified. Of these, the five most abundant that were unique to all five inoculated substrates included: 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol, 4-ethylphenol, butyrolactone, phenylethyl alcohol, and 3-hydroxy-2-butanone. Therefore, these metabolites can be used as markers for the identification of P. cinnamomi in different growing environments. Some VOCs were specific to a particular substrate; for example, 2,4,6-rrimethyl-heptanes, dl-6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol, dimethyl trisulfide, 6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-ol, and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol were specific to P. cinnamomi + V8A; heptanes and 5-methyl-3-heptaneone were specific to P. cinnamomi + PDA; 3-methyl-1-butanol, ethyl acetate, 2-methyl-propanoic acid, ethyl ester, and ethyl ester 2-methyl-butanoic acid were specific to P. cinnamomi inoculated lupin seedlings; and benzyl alcohol and 4-ethyl-1, 2-dimethoxybenzene were only detected in the headspace of inoculated soil + lupin seedlings. Results from this investigation have multiple impacts as the volatile organic profiles produced by the pathogen can be utilized as an early warning system to detect the pathogen from contaminated field soil samples. Data from this investigation have also illuminated potential metabolic pathways utilized by the oomycete during infection which may serve as potential targets for the development of specific control strategies.

AB The tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is considered to be a major pest that damages tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L; Solanaceae) crops in South American, European, and Mediterranean countries. This insect species is polyphagous (i.e., feeds on many types of food); hence, it could also develop on other cultivated host plants, principally solanaceous plants, such as potato (S. tuberosum L.; Solanaceae) and eggplant (S. melongena L.; Solanaceae). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that host plant choice by adult T. absoluta is influenced by plant volatile organic compounds and larval host plant experience. One tomato cultivar (cv.) 'Moneymaker' and three potato cv. 'Charlotte' 'Bintje,' and 'Nicola' were tested. Using a flying tunnel, we observed that females reared on tomato preferred flying toward tomato and, to a lesser extent, potato cv. 'Charlotte.' These preferences might be explained by the high release of terpenes by these two plants. When conducting oviposition choice assays, we found no preference between tomato and potato in the number of eggs laid by females that had been previously reared on either host plant. This study indicates that the host finding behavior of T. absoluta is mediated by solanaceous volatiles, while oviposition behavior appears to depend on additional stimuli. These results provide baseline information for use in the development of new control strategies against T. absoluta using semiochemicals and plant breeding.

AB Bioaccessibility represents the maximum amount of pollutant ingested with food that is available for intestinal absorption. The measurement of bioaccessibility can achieve a more accurate risk assessment. Thus, in this study, the bioaccessibility of raw/microwave-cooked store-bought food including carrot, potato, white radish, lotus root, sweet corn, long grain rice, soybean, fleshy prawn, eastern oyster, kelp, and common carp were investigated by applying an in vitro digestion method. A validated microwave digestion/ICP-MS method was applied for determining the concentration of Cd. In this study, the concentration of Cd ranged 3.7-215.8 mu g/kg fw in which carrot contained the lowest Cd while the fleshy prawn contained the highest Cd. There are no statistical differences of Cd content in microwave-cooked food and raw food except potato, lotus root, and eastern oyster. Cd in most of the cooked food materials was less bioaccessible than in raw food except sweet corn, potato, and kelp. The bioaccessibility of Cd was around 100 % in either raw or cooked potatoes. Microwave cooking caused the decreasing of bioaccessibility around 0-68 %, depending on different food matrix. Maximal decreasing of Cd bioaccessibility occurred in common carp. Thus, microwave cooking could be a feasible strategy for decreasing Cd bioaccessibility. In addition, the Cd dissolution in oral, gastric, and small intestine phase was different in different food matrix. For most of the investigated food items, Cd was largely migrated either into the oral phase (carrot, potato, white radish, lotus root, raw soybean, kelp, and common carp) or into the gastric phase (sweet corn, cooked soybean, rice, fleshy prawn, and eastern oyster). Our findings will have significant implications for food processing aiming to decrease the absorption of Cd and risk assessment analysis improvements. Further study is needed to use the animal model to validate these results.

AB Transgenic potatoes expressing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD), isolated from the oyster mushroom, Pleurotus sajor-caju, had increased tolerance to salt stress (Jeong et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 278:192-196, 2000). To examine the physiological mechanisms enhancing salt tolerance in GPD-transgenic rice plants, the salt tolerance of five GPD transgenic rice lines (T1-T5) derived from Dongjin rice cultivar were evaluated in a fixed 150 mM saline environment in comparison to two known wild-type rice cultivars, Dongjin (salt sensitive) and Pokali (salt tolerant). Transgenic lines, T2, T3, and T5, had a substantial increase in biomass and relative water content compared to Dongjin. Stomatal conductance and osmotic potential were higher in the GPD transgenic lines and were similar to those in Pokali. The results are discussed based on the comparative physiological response of GPD transgenic lines with those of the salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant rice cultivars.

AB When starch is incorporated into puddings, desserts, and other foods containing sugar as the main ingredient, it will have an effect on the gelatinisation temperature and pasting properties. Many studies have been undertaken to investigate the effect of several sugars in foods and starches, as well as their physicochemical and functional properties. These studies have verified the significant influence on these properties, which are dependent on the nature of sugar and of starch. In this study, pinho starch was extracted in the laboratory and was added, stirring for 60 min, to solutions at 1 % of each of the following sugars: fructose, glucose, sucrose, and 0.5 % fructose and 0.5 % glucose. After this time, the slurry was filtered, washed, dried at 40 A degrees C and kept in a desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride until constant mass. The effects of each sugar on the surface of the pinho starch granules were observed using the non-contact method of atomic force microscopy, whereby it was possible to verify a decrease in the average diameter and an increase in the average roughness. X-ray diffractometry made it possible to evaluate the degree of relative crystallinity, which was proportional to the roughness and inversely proportional to the gelatinisation enthalpy (Delta H), which was studied by differential scanning calorimetry.

AB Streptomyces scabies is the main causative agent of common scab disease, which leads to significant annual losses to potato growers worldwide. The main virulence factor produced by S. scabies is a phytotoxic secondary metabolite called thaxtomin A, which functions as a cellulose synthesis inhibitor. Thaxtomin A production is controlled by the cluster-situated regulator TxtR, which activates expression of the thaxtomin biosynthetic genes in response to cello-oligosaccharides. Here, we demonstrate that at least five additional regulatory genes are required for wild-type levels of thaxtomin A production and plant pathogenicity in S. scabies. These regulatory genes belong to the bld gene family of global regulators that control secondary metabolism or morphological differentiation in Streptomyces spp. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that expression of the thaxtomin biosynthetic genes was significantly downregulated in all five bld mutants and, in four of these mutants, this downregulation was attributed to the reduction in expression of txtR. Furthermore, all of the mutants displayed reduced expression of other known or predicted virulence genes, suggesting that the bld genes may function as global regulators of virulence gene expression in S. scabies.

AB A new symptomatology was observed in celery (Apium graveolens) in Villena, Spain in 2008. Symptomatology included an abnormal amount of shoots per plant and curled stems. These vegetative disorders were associated with 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' and not with phytoplasmas. Samples from plant sap were immobilized on membranes based on the spot procedure and tested using a newly developed real-time polymerase chain reaction assay to detect 'Ca. L. solanacearum'. Then, a test kit was developed and validated by intralaboratory assays with an accuracy of 100%. Bacterial-like cells with typical morphology of 'Ca. Liberibacter' were observed using electron microscopy in celery plant tissues. A fifth haplotype of 'Ca. L. solanacearum', named E, was identified in celery and in carrot after analyzing partial sequences of 16S and 50S ribosomal RNA genes. From our results, celery (family Apiaceae) can be listed as a new natural host of this emerging bacterium.

AB The effects of resveratrol and pterostilbene on in vitro growth of three soybean pathogens were tested to determine whether these stilbenic compounds could potentially be targets to increase innate resistance in transgenic soybean plants. Growth of Macrophomina phaseolina, Rhizoctonia solani, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was measured on solid and in liquid media amended with resveratrol and pterostilbene (concentration in the media of resveratrol at 100 mu g/ml and pterostilbene at 25 mu g/ml). All three fungi were very sensitive to pterostilbene in potato dextrose agar (PDA), which reduced colony area of each of the three pathogens to less than half of the control 3 days after incubation. The three fungal pathogens were less sensitive to resveratrol compared with pterostilbene; however, area under the curve (AUC) calculated from colony areas measured over 3 days was significantly (P < 0.05) less than the control for S. sclerotiorum and R. solani on PDA with resveratrol or pterostilbene. AUC for M. phaseolina on PDA with pterostilbene was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the control whereas, on PDA with resveratrol, AUC for M. phaseolina was lower than the control but the difference was nonsignificant (P > 0.05). AUC for all three fungi was significantly lower (P < 0.05) on PDA with pterostilbene than with resveratrol. In potato dextrose broth (PDB) shake cultures, AUC for all three fungi was significantly (P < 0.01) lower in pterostilbene than in the control. AUC for R. solani and S. sclerotiorum was significantly lower (P < 0.01) in resveratrol than the control, whereas AUC for M. phaseolina in resveratrol was lower, but not significantly (P > 0.05) different from the control. AUC in pterostilbene was highly significantly (P < 0.01) lower than in resveratrol for M. phaseolina and significantly (P < 0.05) lower for R. solani but the difference for S. sclerotiorum was nonsignificant (P > 0.05). There was a trend for lower mass accumulation of all three fungi in either pterostilbene or resveratrol compared with the control during the course of the experiment; however, S. sclerotiorum appeared to recover from the effects of pterostilbene between days 2 and 4. Results of biochemical analyses of the PDB over time indicated that the three fungi degraded resveratrol, with nearly 75% reduction in concentration in M. phaseolina, 80% in S. sclerotiorum, and 60% in R. solani PDB cultures by day 4 of fungal growth. M. phaseolina and S. sclerotiorum were able to resume growth after early inhibition by resveratrol after its concentration was reduced in the cultures through degradation, whereas R. solani was less efficient in resveratrol degradation and was not able to overcome its inhibitory effects on growth. The capacity to degrade pterostilbene was lowest in M. phaseolina compared with S. sclerotiorum and R. solani and the recovery of M. phaseolina cultures after initial growth inhibition by pterostilbene was minimal. The potential products of resveratrol and pterostilbene degradation by fungi were identified to be dimers and various oxidation products.

AB Yield, cost, and revenue functions of potato (cv. Agria) were developed from field experiments in 2007-2008, which were designed to determine the response of tuber yield to no irrigation for two weeks at tuber bulking (TB) and tuber ripening (TR). Deficit-irrigated treatments were compared to a well-irrigated control (C) throughout the growing season. The yield-profit maximization methodology of English (1990) was reviewed and a new procedure based on optimization software was proposed. Treatment with deficit irrigation at TB achieved marketable yield 12% lower than that obtained in the well-irrigated control (60.5 Mg ha(-1)), whereas deficit irrigation at TR reduced tuber yield by 42%, compared to the control. However, yield reduction was compensated by an increase in tuber dry matter in the deficit-irrigated treatments. The results of the newly proposed yield-profit maximization procedure show that when land is limiting, the level of water applied at which net income per unit of land is maximized (W-l) fits the yield maximizing (W-m) strategy, while when water is limiting, the level of water applied at which net income per unit of water is maximized (W-w) would result in as much water saving as 10-15% of total applied water. The results also suggest that the target yield that was obtained in the treatment with deficit irrigation at tuber bulking (53.6 t ha(-1)) was in the range of 500-560 mm of water application. We concluded that deficit irrigation at tuber bulking for two weeks is a suitable scenario for potato farming, with potential benefits resulting from reduced irrigation costs.

AB Viroids of the genus Pospiviroid are able to induce diseases in a wide range of host plants including important crop species. Although occasional disease outbreaks of Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) and closely related pospiviroids have been reported in potato and tomato, recent studies found an increase in number of latent infections in ornamental solanaceous species. In order to verify the presence of PSTVd and other pospiviroids in Croatia, a survey was conducted between 2009 and 2012. A total of 182 samples belonging to five ornamental species and two solanaceous crops were analyzed. Eight plants belonging to two different species (Solanum jasminodes and Lycianthes rantonnetii) were found infected by PSTVd and, in addition, one S. jasminoides plant infected by Tomato apical stunt viroid (TASVd). Viroid infection was confirmed by mechanical inoculation on tomato plants to observe symptom expression. Molecular characterization of the isolates was done and complete viroid sequences were submitted to the GenBank. This is the first evidence of the presence of PSTVd and TASVd and their variability in Croatia.

AB BACKGROUND: Mineral oils are increasingly sprayed to manage potato virus Y (PVY). However, the mode of accumulation and movement of mineral oil in the potato plant has not been understood. This information is important for optimisation of the concentration and frequency of spraying. During the 2012 season, cvs Russet Burbank and Shepody were planted in the field and in the greenhouse, respectively, and were subjected to mineral oil treatments. The plant samples from the treatment plots were collected, and oil was extracted and quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
   RESULTS: Mineral oil stayed in the vicinity of the sprayed leaves and did not move from leaflet to leaflet or from leaflet to stem, stolon, tuber or root. Following spraying, the oil content in the plant leaves diluted as time progressed. At plant maturity, leaves sampled from the greenhouse sprayed plants had about 4 times more oil content than those sampled from the field sprayed plants. Plots treated with regular spray of mineral oil showed low PVY incidences at crop harvest.
   CONCLUSION: The information generated in this study on the pattern of accumulation and movement of mineral oil in greenhouse-and field-grown potato plants shows that, as the oil does not move from leaflet to leaflet, frequent mineral oil sprays from crop emergence to harvest are required to prevent PVY infection in newly emerged leaflets and seasonal spread of PVY. The frequency of sprays may be kept higher from early to mid-stage, when plant growth is faster, and lower close to plant maturity. (C) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry

AB BACKGROUND: The grain aphid, Sitobion avenae Fabricius (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is an important pest of cereal crops. Pesticides are the main method for control but carry the risk of selecting for resistance. In response to reports of reduced efficacy of pyrethroid sprays applied to S. avenae, field samples were collected and screened for mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel, the primary target site for pyrethroids. Aphid mobility and mortality to lambda-cyhalothrin were measured in coated glass vial bioassays.
   RESULTS: A single amino acid substitution (L1014F) was identified in the domain IIS6 segment of the sodium channel from the S. avenae samples exhibiting reduced pyrethroid efficacy. Bioassays on aphids heterozygous for the kdr mutation (SR) or homozygous for the wild-type allele (SS) showed that those carrying the mutation had significantly lower susceptibility to lambda-cyhalothrin.
   CONCLUSION: The L1014F (kdr) mutation, known to confer pyrethroid resistance in many insect pests, has been identified for the first time in S. avenae. Clonal lines heterozygous for the mutation showed 35-40-fold resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin in laboratory bioassays, consistent with the reported effect of this mutation on pyrethroid sensitivity in other aphid species.

AB The importance of glucan chains that pass through both the amorphous and crystalline lamellae (tie chains) in the organization of corn starch granules was studied using heat-moisture treatment (HMT), annealing (ANN), and iodine binding. Molecular structural analysis showed that hylon starches (HV, HVII, and HVIII) contained higher proportion of intermediate glucan chains (HVIII > HVII > HV) than normal corn (CN) starch. Wide angle X-ray scattering revealed that on HMT, the extent of polymorphic transition in hylon starches decreased with increasing proportion of intermediate and long chains. Iodine treated hylon starches exhibited increased order in the V-type polymorphism as evidenced by the intense peak at 20 degrees 2 theta and the strong reflection intensity at 7.5 degrees 2 theta and the extent of the change depended on the type of hylon starch. DSC results showed that the gelatinization enthalpy of CN and waxy corn starch (CW) remained unchanged after ANN. However, hylon starches showed a significant increase in enthalpy with more distinct endotherms after ANN. It can be concluded that tie chains influence the organization of crystalline lamellae in amylose extender mutant starches. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae), native to tropical Asian regions, has become a serious threat to palm trees all over the world. Knowledge of its flight potential is vital to improving the preventive and curative measures currently used to manage this pest. As R. ferrugineus is a quarantine pest, it is difficult to study its flight potential in the field. A computer-monitored flight mill was adapted to analyse the flying ability of R. ferrugineus through the study of different flight parameters (number of flights, total distance flown, longest single flight, flight duration, and average and maximum speed) and the influence of the weevil's sex, age, and body size on these flight parameters. Despite significant differences in the adult body size (body weight and length) of males and females, the sex of R. ferrugineus adults did not have an influence on their flight potential. Neither adult body size nor age was found to affect the weevil's flying abilities, although there was a significantly higher percentage of individuals flying that were 8-23 days old than 1-7 days old. Compared to the longest single flight, 54% of the insects were classified as short-distance flyers (covering <100 m) and 36 and 10% were classified as medium- (100-5000m) and long-distance (>5000 m), respectively. The results are compared with similar studies on different insect species under laboratory and field conditions.

AB Potatoes produce biologically active secondary metabolites like glycoalkaloids and their aglycons, which may have both adverse and beneficial effects in the diet. A new analytical method that uses liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LTQ-Orbitrap) has been developed for the analysis of glycoalkaloids and their aglycons in potato samples. Two glycoalkaloids, alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine, and two aglycons, demissidine and solasodine, were quantified in potato samples. Samples were extracted using methanol, purified on an SPE Strata C-18 cartridge, and then analyzed in HPLC-mass spectrometry (LTQ-Orbitrap) with the FTMS operating in full scan at a resolving power of 30,000 (FWHM), enabling the detection and accurate mass measurement and with the ITMS mode operating in MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) for glycoalkaloids and their aglycons using the [M + H](+) ions and their optimized collision energies. After validation, the method was applied to screen different type of potatoes, and some cooking experiment were conducted.

AB Nutrients such as boron, nitrogen and calcium stimulate the production of phenols. This research focuses on the role of calcium in increasing phenol metabolism in potato peels and the ensuing tuber resistance to soft rot pathogens was investigated. Two field experiments were conducted at the University of Zimbabwe campus plots in 2008 and 2009 summer seasons. Sprouted tubers of cv. BPI were planted in plots treated with different fertilizer combinations. The treatments were: 1) compound S (7N: 21P: 8K) + ammonium nitrate (34 %N) 2) compound D (7N: 14P: 7K) + calcium nitrate (19 Ca: 15.5N) 3) compound S + calcium nitrate and 4) compound D + ammonium nitrate. The harvested progeny tubers were inoculated with Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense. Calcium amendment increased the activities of enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidases) involved in the metabolism of phenolics and total soluble phenols. Calcium amendment significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the maceration effect of P. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense in tuber tissues. Chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and calcium, but not ferulic acid content were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in plants grown in calcium treated plots. Calcium positively and significantly correlated with polyphenol oxidase (PPO), phenylalanine (PAL) and peroxidase (POD), while chlorogenic and caffeic acid showed a positive relationship with POD and PPO. Calcium amendment significantly reduced maceration symptom caused by the bacteria (P < 0.05), resulting in smaller decayed zone diameters on inoculated tubers from calcium-treated plots. This study shows that soil amendments of calcium increase concentration of calcium, caffeic and chlorogenic acid in tuber peels and also reduces maceration effect of pectinolytic pathogens. Reduced maceration could be due to increased levels of caffeic and chlorogenic acid which have antimicrobial properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Use of host plant resistance is an essential component of integrated management of Thrips tabaci Lindeman. The present research was designed to screen five commercial cultivars of potato, namely Agria, Kondor, Morene, Diamant and Savalan, and two breeding lines 397082-2 and Khavaran for their susceptibility to thrips infestation and for their mean relative plant growth rate (MRGR) and crop yield in an experimental field (not frected with insecticides) and a control field (chlorpyrifos frected) in the Ardabil region of Iran in 2011 and 2012. Thrips populations were assessed by visual inspection on potato leaves. At harvest time, the percentage of leaf area damaged by thrips infestation was assessed on leaves of the tested genotypes. All adults of phytophagous thrips collected in the experimental field were T. tabaci. In both years the mean numbers of thrips adults and larvae were lowest on Savalan cultivar among the tested genotypes. The mean damage index was also lowest on Savalan in both years and the MRGR and the mean yield were greatest in Savalan in the control field. Moreover, in thrips-infested plants, the lowest percentage of MRGR loss and the lowest percentage of yield reduction were observed in Savalan (3.7% and 5.8%, respectively). Of the genotypes tested, Savalan is the most resistant host and has potential for use in the sustainable management of T. tabaci on potato. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases has caused grievous global warming and associated consequences. Lowering carbon footprint to promote the development of cleaner production demands the immediate attention. In this study, the carbon footprint calculations were performed on five cropping systems in North China Plain from 2003 to 2010. The five cropping systems included sweet potato -> cotton -> sweet potato -> winter wheat-summer maize (SpCSpWS, 4-year cycle), ryegrass-cotton -> peanut -> winter wheat-summer maize (RCPWS, 3-year cycle), peanut -> winter wheat-summer maize (PWS, 2-year cycle), winter wheat-summer maize (WS, 1-year cycle), and continuous cotton (Cont C), established in a randomized complete-block design with three replicates. We used a modified carbon footprint calculation with localized greenhouse gas emissions parameters to analyze the carbon footprint of each cropping system per unit area, per kg biomass, and per unit economic output. Results showed that the lowest annual carbon footprint values were observed in SpCSpWS among the five cropping systems, which were only 27.9%, 28.2% and 25.0% of those in WS rotation system (the highest carbon footprint) in terms of per unit area, per unit biomass, and per unit economic output, respectively. The five cropping systems showed the order of SpCSpWS < Cont C < RCPWS < PWS < WS sorting by their annual carbon footprint calculated by all the three metrics above-mentioned. Results revealed that appropriate diversified crop rotation systems could contribute to decreased carbon footprint compared with conventional intensive crop production system in North China Plain.

AB Elytrigia repens is a rhizomatous perennial weed prevalent in organic cropping systems in Scandinavia. This study analysed the population dynamics of E. repens in a long-term crop rotation experiment on coarse sand in Denmark in order to gain insights into the factors influencing its population changes, especially those important for outbreaks of E. repens infestations. Data were obtained from three cycles of four-year crop rotations with various cash crops and annual grass-clover subjected to four treatment combinations: with and without animal manure and with and without catch crops. E. repens was controlled by different tillage and mowing strategies between and within crops. Pulses and spring cereals caused the highest population increases, especially when preceded by grass-clover. Potatoes grown in ridges and winter rye suppressed the E. repens population, but tillage between crops was necessary to decrease the population. Manuring generally reduced E. repens growth by 28%. Thus there are crops that need particular attention when designing crop sequences, provision of sufficient nutrients is important to strengthen crop suppression of weeds, and mechanical interventions are needed to manage E. repens satisfactorily.

AB BACKGROUND: In conventional manufacturing of potato chips, achieving an extremely low moisture content (2% by weight) in the final product necessitates prolonged exposure of potato slices to high oil temperatures. This promotes acrylamide formation and causes an exponential increase in acrylamide level toward the end of the frying process. In this regard, frying potato slices partially in hot oil followed by a radio-frequency (RF) drying treatment to selectively heat the remaining moisture appears to be a viable approach in terms of limiting acrylamide formation.
   RESULTS: RF post-drying of partially fried potato slices resulted in lower acrylamide levels (80.4 ng g(-1) for control, 59.4 ng g(-1) for RF post-dried potato slices partially fried for 95s, 54.8 ng g(-1) for RF post-dried potato slices partially fried for 80s). This process modification also led a to 12% reduction in oil content in the final product. According to instrumental analysis results, RF post-dried samples had lower hardness and a slightly lower degree of browning in comparison to control. No significant difference (alpha = 0.05) was found between samples in terms of sensory characteristics.
   CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate that RF post-processing may be an effective strategy for minimising acrylamide levels of potato chips without adversely affecting quality attributes. (C) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Frameworks describing the overall assessment of sustainability are limited and usually not well described. This study proposes a protocol for the selection and quantification of indicators that can be used to discuss and communicate the sustainability of agri-food production systems. A gross list of indicators was established covering the social, environmental and economic dimensions. Core indicators were selected from this gross list using predefined criteria. Then, sustainability limits were set for these core indicators to evaluate their sustainability impact. Policy makers can determine the effects of different weights and the extent to which indicators can compensate each other (compensability) either at the level of the individual indicator or on the overall sustainability. The protocol was tested in a case study comparing potato production in pen-urban agriculture to conventional and to organic agriculture. Data were based on literature, expert opinion and additional calculations. Application in the case study showed that the protocol can be a valuable tool in assessing the sustainability of agri-food production systems. It enables more transparent policy decisions and facilitates communication with stakeholders about these decisions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Near-infrared (NIR) quantum cutting (QC) YBO3: Ce3+, Yb3+ phosphors have been synthesized by solvothermal method with further heat treatment. The emission spectrum shows the Vis and NIR emission intensity of samples are both increasingly strong as annealing temperature rises when the annealing temperature is above 600 degrees C. Meanwhile the Vis emission of unannealed sample is observed. SEM images show that the sample annealed at different temperatures (200-900 degrees C) is mainly composed of nanosheets like potato chips, which is melt down granules after annealing treatment above 1000 degrees C. The crystal texture of all samples whether annealed or not is hexagonal through the analysis of XRD. The Raman and infrared spectrums indicate that the boron ions exist of BO4 units when the annealing temperature is above 600 degrees C. The infrared profile of unannealed sample shows that there are N-H units in the samples without annealing treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the effect of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on soil nematodes and water may explain plant damage in the field and how some nematode management strategies reduce soil nematode populations. M. incognita is a damaging plant pathogenic nematode that affects crops worldwide. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of the VOCs emitted by five common crops used for soil incorporation to control the second-stage juveniles (J(2)) of Meloidogyne incognita. To investigate the "in vitro" role of water in the relationship between nematodes and plant VOCs. And to identify the volatile molecules by gas chromatography (GC/MS). The method used permitted the volatile molecules from macerated plant organs to only contact the J(2) nematodes by air. Plants organs from all plants macerated with and without water emitted VOCs that immobilized J(2) nematodes, with higher levels emitted when the plant organs were macerated without water. Only water exposed to VOCs from neem and mustard leaves were capable of immobilizing M. incognita J(2). The M. incognita J(2) exposed to neem and mustard VOCs and inoculated in tomato seedlings resulted in reduced gall formation and nematode reproduction, showing the nematicidal effect of the plant-emitted VOCs. GC/MS analysis revealed the presence of 58 and 32 molecules in the VOCs emitted from neem and mustard macerates, respectively. Alcohols were found in both the neem and mustard VOCs. Esters were found in the neem VOCs, and sulfur-containing compounds, mostly isothiocyanates, were found in mustard. Our results demonstrate that plant VOCs contain diversified molecules that affect M. incognita mobility, pathogenicity and reproduction. Nematode toxic VOCs may be retained in water, which prevents the VOCs from escaping into the air and causing the water to become toxic to nematodes. These data may explain part of the role of VOCs in the biofumigation process, through plant incorporation with the soil, and suggests that irrigation performed directly after incorporation may trap the VOCs in soil water and thereafter retain nematode toxicity longer than incorporation that is performed later.

AB Near-infrared (NIR) transmittance spectroscopy, visible/NIR interactance spectroscopy, and visible/NIR hyperspectral imaging modes were used to determine the potential for rapid electronic estimation of glucose, sucrose, specific gravity, primordial leaf count, and soluble solids of (FL) (chipping) and Russet Norkotah (RN) (table) potato cultivars. Whole tubers and 0.5 inch (12.54 mm) slices were evaluated. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to obtain the prediction models. Models for leaf counts and glucose were promising for all modes with the optimum model obtained for leaf count from interactance with sliced samples resulting in R (RPD) values of 0.95(3.29) for FL, and 0.90(2.19) for RN. For glucose, interactance also yielded the best model with R (RPD) values of 0.90(2.14) for FL, and 0.95(3.12) for RN. Models of other constituents were inconsistent between systems. Interactance mode with sliced samples showed best performance for soluble solids for FL with R (RPD) values of 0.55(1.18). Also, interactance mode demonstrated optimal performance for sucrose estimation with R (RPD) values of 0.81(1.63) for FL obtained from sliced samples, and 0.81(1.64) from whole tubers. Transmittance mode with sliced samples showed the best prediction models for RN with R (RPD) values of 0.63(1.30) for sucrose. Finally, specific gravity under interactance and transmittance modes with sliced samples for FL and RN respectively yielded R (RPD) values of 0.61(1.27), and 0.59(1.22). (C) 2014 Elsevierer Ltd.

AB Self-fermentation of cellulosic substrates to produce biohydrogen without inoculum addition nor pretreatments was investigated. Dark fermentation of two different substrates made of leaf-shaped vegetable refuses (V) and leaf-shaped vegetable refuses plus potato peels (VP), was taken in consideration. Batch experiments were carried out, under two mesophilic anaerobic conditions (28 and 37 degrees C), in order to isolate and to identify potential H-2-producing bacterial strains contained in the vegetable extracts. The effect of initial glucose concentration (at 1, 5 and 10 g/L) on fermentative H-2 production by the isolates was also evaluated.
   H-2 production from self-fermentation of both biomasses was found to be feasible, without methane evolution, showing the highest yield for V biomass at 28 degrees C (24 L/kg VS). The pH control of the culture medium proved to be a critical parameter. The isolates had sequence similarities >= 98% with already known strains, belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae (gamma-proteobacteria) and Streptococcaceae (Firmicutes). Four genera found in the samples, namely Pectobacterium, Raoultella, Rahnella and Lactococcus have not been previously described for H-2 production from glucose. The isolates showed higher yield (1.6-2.2 mol H-2/mol glucose(added)) at low glucose concentration (1 g/L), while the maximum H-2 production ranged from 410 to 1016 mL/L and was obtained at a substrate concentration of 10 g/L. The results suggested that vegetable waste can be effectively used as both, substrate and source of suitable microflora for bio-hydrogen production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the effects of salts on the physicochemical, microstructural and thermal properties of potato starch. The salting-out ions were able to decrease the solubility, swelling power, transparency and particle size of potato starch significantly (p < 0.05), while the salting-in ions increased these properties significantly (p < 0.05). The microstructure of potato starch granules, observed by a light microscopy at 50 degrees C and 70 degrees C, was consistent with the above results. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis demonstrated an increase in gelatinization temperature and enthalpy with the addition of salting-out ions, whereas there was a reverse trend for the addition of salting-in ions. The effects of anions on these properties of potato starch follow the order of SCN- > I- > NO3- > Br- > Cl- > SO42- > F-, while effects of the cations follow the order of Lr+ > Na+ > K+, matching to the order of the Hofmeister series.

AB In this study, the nutritional compositions of leaves from 40 sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) cultivars were assessed. The correlations between antioxidant activity and crude protein, crude fat, crude fiber, carbohydrate, and polyphenol contents were determined. The crude protein, crude fiber, crude fat, carbohydrate and ash contents ranged between 16.69-31.08, 9.15-14.26, 2.08-5.28, 42.03-61.36, and 7.39-14.66 g/100 g dry weight (DW), respectively. According to the index of nutritional quality, sweet potato leaves are good sources of protein, fiber, and minerals, especially K, P, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, and Cu. The correlation coefficient between antioxidant activity and total polyphenol content was the highest (0.76032, p < 0.0001), indicating that polyphenols are important antioxidants in sweet potato leaves. Sweet potato leaves, which contain several nutrients and bioactive compounds, should be consumed as leafy vegetables in an attempt to reduce malnutrition, especially in developing countries.

AB Functional, physico-chemical properties and FTIR analysis of flours and starches of two African rice cultivars (Transgressive Segregants TGS 3 and TGS 25) were investigated. The TGS 3 showed higher 1000 kernel grain weight (29.55 g), dockage (1.00 g), immature grain (1.97 g), thickness (2.10 mm), chalkiness (11.17%) and damaged grain (0.70%). However, the TGS 25 showed higher head rice yield (51.11%), milling degree (9.60%), length (6.88 mm) and elongation ratio (3.64). Also, the TGS 25 showed higher alkaline spread value (6.67), amylose content (30.81%), uncooked (7.15 mm) and cooked (10.17 mm) rice length. The WAC (2.77 g/mL) and OAC (1.08 g/mL) of TGS 25 flours were higher than TGS 3. The L value of TGS 25 flour (92.13) and starch (97.88) were higher than those of TGS 3. The TGS 3 flour and starch showed higher peak, breakdown and peak times of 4308 and 3531 cP, 2200 and 1947 cP, 5.43 and 4.60 min, respectively. The TGS 25 (85.67 degrees C) starch showed significantly higher boiling point than the TGS 3 (81.33 degrees C). Pasting temperatures of TGS 3 and TGS 25 starches were 78.65 and 78.75 degrees C, respectively. Cyclodextrin (A and B) and L (-) glucose were detected in the starch and flour of TGS 25 but were present in TGS 3 starch but absent in its flour. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The emulsifying properties and emulsion stability of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil in water emulsions stabilized by plant proteins (potato, soy, and pea) as well as those extracted from milk (sodium caseinate and whey) have been investigated at two different pH values (7 and 10). The effect of protein type, concentration, pH and temperature has been studied using droplet size distribution, interfacial tension, and interfacial elasticity measurements. The interfacial tension is measured as a function of concentration ranging from 0.01% to 2.5% using the pendant drop method. The interfacial elasticity is also measured using the oscillating drop technique. The stability of the resulted emulsions is assessed using a stress test whereby the emulsions are placed at 60 or 40 degrees C for 24 h by measuring the droplet size distribution before and after the stress test. The interfacial tension decreases with increase of the pH and increase of the protein concentration pH value. A higher elasticity at the oil/water interface is obtained at pH = 10 when compared to that at pH = 7 for both Na-caseinate and pea proteins. Fine and stable emulsions are obtained at pH = 10, showing good correlation between interfacial tension and emulsion formation as well as between interfacial elasticity and emulsion stability for milk and plant proteins.

AB The effect of alkali-treatment for 0, 15, and 30 days at 35 degrees C on amylose content, morphological properties, crystalline properties, swelling power, solubility, absorbance spectra and in vitro digestibility of starches from Dioscorea zingiberensis, Dioscorea persimilis and Dioscorea opposita were investigated. The amylose content of all the three starches decreased after 15 days of alkaline treatment and then increased after 30 days of alkaline treatment. There were similar changes in relative crystallinity for D. zingiberensis and D. persimilis starches. It was observed that the three starches displayed a reduction trend in swelling power with a significant increase in solubility. Adhesion among some of the starch granules was observed after alkali-treatment for 30 days in D. zingiberensis and D. opposita starches, while D. persimilis starch showed some hollows on the granule surface. The rise in the absorbance ratio of 1047/1035 and 1047/1022 cm(-1) from FT-IR was observed during alkali-treatment for D. persimilis and D. opposita starches. Alkali-treatment elevated the in vitro digestibility with resistant starch values climbing up from 50.16% to 64.95% and from 66.14% to 70.74% for D. zingiberensis and D. persimilis starches, respectively, but there was no significant change in resistant starch value for D. opposita starch.

AB Previous studies have shown that methionine from root exudates affects the rhizosphere bacterial population involved in soil nitrogen fixation. A transgenic line of Zigongdongdou soybean cultivar (ZD91) that expresses Arabidopsis cystathionine c-synthase resulting in an increased methionine production was examined for its influence to the rhizosphere bacterial population. Using 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing analysis of the V4 region and DNA extracted from bacterial consortia collected from the rhizosphere of soybean plants grown in an agricultural field at the pod-setting stage, we characterized the populational structure of the bacterial community involved. In total, 87,267 sequences (approximately 10,908 per sample) were analyzed. We found that Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes, and Verrucomicrobia constitute the dominant taxonomic groups in either the ZD91 transgenic line or parental cultivar ZD, and that there was no statistically significant difference in the rhizosphere bacterial community structure between the two cultivars.

AB Background: To predict further invasions of pests it is important to understand what factors contribute to the genetic structure of their populations. Cosmopolitan pest species are ideal for studying how different agroecosystems affect population genetic structure within a species at different climatic extremes. We undertook the first population genetic study of the greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum), a cosmopolitan invasive herbivore, and examined the genetic structure of this species in Northern and Southern Europe. In Finland, cold temperatures limit whiteflies to greenhouses and prevent them from overwintering in nature, and in Greece, milder temperatures allow whiteflies to inhabit both fields and greenhouses year round, providing a greater potential for connectivity among populations. Using nine microsatellite markers, we genotyped 1274 T. vaporariorum females collected from 18 greenhouses in Finland and eight greenhouses as well as eight fields in Greece.
   Results: Populations from Finland were less diverse than those from Greece, suggesting that Greek populations are larger and subjected to fewer bottlenecks. Moreover, there was significant population genetic structure in both countries that was explained by different factors. Habitat (field vs. greenhouse) together with longitude explained genetic structure in Greece, whereas in Finland, genetic structure was explained by host plant species. Furthermore, there was no temporal genetic structure among populations in Finland, suggesting that year-round populations are able to persist in greenhouses.
   Conclusions: Taken together our results show that greenhouse agroecosystems can limit gene flow among populations in both climate zones. Fragmented populations in greenhouses could allow for efficient pest management. However, pest persistence in both climate zones, coupled with increasing opportunities for naturalization in temperate latitudes due to climate change, highlight challenges for the management of cosmopolitan pests in Northern and Southern Europe.

AB Background: The polyadenylation of RNA is critical for gene functioning, but the conserved sequence motifs (often called signal or signature motifs), motif locations and abundances, and base composition patterns around mRNA polyadenylation [poly(A)] sites are still uncharacterized in most species. The evolutionary tendency for poly(A) site selection is still largely unknown.
   Results: We analyzed the poly(A) site regions of 31 species or phyla. Different groups of species showed different poly(A) signal motifs: UUACUU at the poly(A) site in the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi; UGUAAC (approximately 13 bases upstream of the site) in the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; UGUUUG (or UGUUUGUU) at mainly the fourth base downstream of the poly(A) site in the parasite Blastocystis hominis; and AAUAAA at approximately 16 bases and approximately 19 bases upstream of the poly(A) site in animals and plants, respectively. Polyadenylation signal motifs are usually several hundred times more abundant around poly(A) sites than in whole genomes. These predominant motifs usually had very specific locations, whether upstream of, at, or downstream of poly(A) sites, depending on the species or phylum. The poly(A) site was usually an adenosine (A) in all analyzed species except for B. hominis, and there was weak A predominance in C. reinhardtii. Fungi, animals, plants, and the protist Phytophthora infestans shared a general base abundance pattern (or base composition pattern) of "U-rich-A-rich-U-rich-Poly(A) site-U-rich regions", or U-A-U-A-U for short, with some variation for each kingdom or subkingdom.
   Conclusion: This study identified the poly(A) signal motifs, motif locations, and base composition patterns around mRNA poly(A) sites in protists, fungi, plants, and animals and provided insight into poly(A) site evolution.

AB A multitarget TaqMan real-time PCR (RTi-PCR) based system was developed to monitor unauthorized genetically modified (GM) events in India. Most of the GM events included in this study are either authorized for commercial cultivation or field trials, which were indigenously developed or imported for research purposes. The developed system consists of a 96-well prespotted plate with lyophilized primers and probes, for simultaneous detection of 47 targets in duplicate, including 21 event-specific sequences, 5 construct regions, 15 for transgenic elements, and 6 taxon-specific targets for cotton, eggplant, maize, potato, rice, and soybean. Limit of detection (LOD) of assays ranged from 0.1 to 0.01% GM content for different targets. Applicability, robustness, and practical utility of the developed system were verified with stacked GM cotton event, powdered samples of proficiency testing and two unknown test samples. This user-friendly multitarget approach can be efficiently utilized for monitoring the unauthorized GM events in an Indian context.

AB The present work evaluates the influence of vessel cooling simultaneously to microwave-assisted digestion performed in a closed system with diluted HNO3 under O-2 pressure. The effect of outside air flow-rates (60-190 m(3) h(-1)) used for cooling of digestion vessels was evaluated. An improvement in digestion efficiency caused by the reduction of HNO3 partial pressure was observed when using higher air flow-rate (190 m(3) h(-1)), decreasing the residual carbon content for whole milk powder from 21.7 to 9.3% (lowest and highest air flow-rate, respectively). The use of high air flow-rate outside the digestion vessel resulted in a higher temperature gradient between liquid and gas phases inside the digestion vessel and improved the efficiency of sample digestion. Since a more pronounced temperature gradient was obtained, it contributed for increasing the condensation rate and thus allowed a reduction in the HNO3 partial pressure of the digestion vessel, which improved the regeneration of HNO3. An air flow-rate of 190 m(3) h(-1) was selected for digestion of animal fat, bovine liver, ground soybean, non fat milk powder, oregano leaves, potato starch and whole milk powder samples, and a standard reference material of apple leaves (NIST 1515), bovine liver (NIST 1577) and whole milk powder (NIST 8435) for further metals determination by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Results were in agreement with certified values and no interferences caused by matrix effects during the determination step were observed. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B. V.

AB Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. Ex Adr. Juss.) Muell.-Arg. is the primary source of natural rubber that is native to the Amazon rainforest. The singular properties of natural rubber make it superior to and competitive with synthetic rubber for use in several applications. Here, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of H. brasiliensis bark on the Illumina GAIIx platform, which generated 179,326,804 raw reads on the Illumina GAIIx platform. A total of 50,384 contigs that were over 400 bp in size were obtained and subjected to further analyses. A similarity search against the non-redundant (nr) protein database returned 32,018 (63%) positive BLASTx hits. The transcriptome analysis was annotated using the clusters of orthologous groups (COG), gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Pfam databases. A search for putative molecular marker was performed to identify simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In total, 17,927 SSRs and 404,114 SNPs were detected. Finally, we selected sequences that were identified as belonging to the mevalonate (MVA) and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathways, which are involved in rubber biosynthesis, to validate the SNP markers. A total of 78 SNPs were validated in 36 genotypes of H. brasiliensis. This new dataset represents a powerful information source for rubber tree bark genes and will be an important tool for the development of microsatellites and SNP markers for use in future genetic analyses such as genetic linkage mapping, quantitative trait loci identification, investigations of linkage disequilibrium and marker-assisted selection.

AB A total of 118 actinobacterial isolates were collected from the three types of termite nests (mound, carton, and subterranean nests) to evaluate their potential as a source of bioactive actinobacteria with antimicrobial activity. The highest number (67 isolates) and generic abundance (7 known genera) of actinobacterial isolates were obtained from carton nests. Streptomyces was the dominant genus in each type of termite nest. In the non-Streptomyces group, Nocardia was the dominant genus detected in mound and carton nests, while Pseudonocardia was the dominant genus in subterranean nests. A discovery trend of novel species (<99% similarity in the 16S rRNA gene sequence) was also observed in the termite nests examined. Each type of termite nest housed >20% of bioactive actinobacteria that could inhibit the growth of at least one test organism, while 12 isolates, belonging to the genera Streptomyces, Amycolatopsis, Pseudonocardia, Micromonospora and Nocardia, exhibited distinct antimicrobial activities. Streptomyces sp. CMU-NKS-3 was the most distinct bioactive isolate. It was closely related to S. padanus MITKK-103T, which was confirmed by 99% similarities in their 16S rRNA gene sequences. The highest level of extracellular antimicrobial substances was produced by the isolate CMU-NKS-3, which was grown in potato dextrose broth and exhibited a wide range (6.10x10(-4)-1.25 mg mL(-1)) of minimum inhibitory concentrations against diverse pathogens. We concluded that termite nests are an abundant source of bioactive strains of cultivable actinobacteria for future biotechnological needs.

AB Seven types of starch (waxy corn, normal corn, waxy rice, normal rice, waxy potato, normal potato, and tapioca) were selected to produce slowly digestible maltodextrins by enzymatic modification using a previously developed procedure. Branching enzyme (BE) alone and in combination with beta-amylase (BA) were used to increase the amount of alpha-1,6 branching points, which are slowly hydrolyzed by mucosal alpha-glucosidases in the small intestine. The enzymatic treatments of all starches resulted in a reduction of the debranched linear chain length distribution and weight-average molecular weight. After a-amylolysis of the enzymatically synthesized-maltodextrins, the proportion of branched a-limit dextrins increased, and consequently a reduction in rate of glucose release by rat intestinal a-glucosidases in vitro. Among the samples, enzyme-modified waxy starches had a more pronounced effect on an increase in the slow digestion property than normal starches. These enzyme-modified maltodextrins show potential as novel functional foods by slowing digestion rate to attain extended glucose release. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The formation of complex was confirmed by FT-IR spectra, thermoanalysis, H-1 NMR and ROESY. The stoichiometry and stability constant were determined by Job's plot and phase solubility studies, respectively. The inclusion complex CIPC.HP beta CD has exhibited different properties from CIPC. The obtained inclusion complex was found to significantly improve the water solubility, thermal stability and dissolution rate of CIPC. In addition, the complex displayed a better effect on sprout inhibition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work we present a rapid, selective, and highly sensitive detection of a-solanine and a-chaconine using cholinesterase-based sensors. The high sensitivity of the devices is brought by the use of a genetically modified acetylcholinesterase (AChE), combined with a one-step detection method based on the measurement of inhibition slope. The selectivity was obtained by using butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), an enzyme able to detect these two toxins with differential inhibition kinetics. The enzymes were immobilized via entrapment in PVA-AWP polymer directly on the working electrode surface. The analysis of the resulting inhibition slope was performed employing linear regression function included in Matlab. The high toxicity of a-chaconine compared to a-solanine due to a better affinity to the active site was proved. The inhibition of glycoalkaloids (GAs) mixture was performed over AChE enzyme wild-type AChE and BChE biosensors resulting in the detection of synergism effect. The developed method allows the detection of (GAs) at 50 ppb in potato matrix. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation indices (VIs) have been used previously for estimating green leaf area index (green LAI). However, it has not been verified how characteristics of the relationships between these indices and green LAI (i.e., slope, intercept, standard error) vary for different crops and whether one universal algorithm may be applied for accurate estimation of green LAI. By analyzing the data from four different crops (maize, soybean, wheat, and potato) this study aimed at: (1) determining if the previously used VIs for estimating green LAI in maize and soybean may be applicable for potato and wheat and vice versa; and (2) finding a robust algorithm for green LAI estimation that does not require re-parameterization for each crop. Spectral measurements of wheat and potato were obtained in Israel from 2004 to 2007 and of maize and soybean in the USA from 2001 to 2008, and various VIs calculated using measured reflectance were compared with green LAI measured in the field. For all four crops, ten different Vls were examined. Similarities in relationships between VIs and green LAI were found. Among the examined Vls, two variants of the chlorophyll index and wide dynamic range vegetation index with the green and red edge bands were the most accurate in estimating green LAI in all four crops. Hyperspectral reflectance data were used to determine optimal diagnostic bands for estimating green LAI in four crops using a universal algorithm. The green (530-570 nm) and red edge (700-725 nm) regions were identified for both the wide dynamic range vegetation index and chlorophyll index as having the lowest errors estimating green LAI. Since the Landsat 8 - OLI has a green spectral band and the forthcoming Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3 and VEN mu S have both green and red edge bands, it is expected that these Vls can be used to monitor green LAI in multiple crops using a single algorithm by means of near future satellite missions.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the properties of resistant starch (RS) III prepared from elephant foot yam starch using pullulanase enzyme. Native and gelatinized starches were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis (pullulanase, 40 U/g per 10 h), autoclaved (121 degrees C/30 min), stored under refrigeration (4 degrees C/24 h) and then lyophilized. After preparation of resistant starch Ill, the morphological, physical, chemical and functional properties were assessed. The enzymatic and retrogradation process increased the yield of resistant starch III from starch with a concomitant increase increase in its water absorption capacity and water solubility index. A decrease in swelling power was observed due to the hydrolysis and thermal process. Te reduced pasting properties and hardness of resistant starch III were associated with the disintegration of starch granules due to the thermal process. The viscosity was found to be inversely proportional to the RS content in the sample. The thermal properties of RS increased due to retrogradation and recrystallization (P < 0.05).

AB Ozone is a more powerful oxidant than common oxidising agents, such as sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide. It is considered as a safer starch modification method for both consumers and the environment. However, few studies have investigated the changes in starch properties associated with ozone treatment, particularly when applied in aqueous solution. This work aimed to evaluate the carbonyl and carboxyl contents, the X-ray diffraction patterns, the spectrum profiles of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the pasting properties and the surface morphology of ozone-oxidised cassava starch during 60 min under different pH (3.5, 6.5 and 9.5) at 25 degrees C. The pH 6.5 and 9.5 seemed to favour the cross-linking between the depolymerised starch molecules during ozonation. The pH 3.5 was more effective in reducing the peak viscosity, breakdown, setback and final viscosity of cassava starch during ozonation in aqueous solution. No differences in the granule surface morphology were observed in the ozone-treated cassava starches compared to native starch. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB RNAi therapeutics is a powerful tool for treating diseases by sequence-specific targeting of genes using siRNA. Since its discovery, the need for a safe and efficient delivery system for siRNA has increased. Here, we have developed and characterized a delivery platform for siRNA based on the natural polysaccharide starch in an attempt to address unresolved delivery challenges of RNAi. Modified potato starch (Q-starch) was successfully obtained by substitution with quaternary reagent, providing Q-starch with cationic properties. The results indicate that Q-starch was able to bind siRNA by self-assembly formation of complexes. For efficient and potent gene silencing we monitored the physical characteristics of the formed nanoparticles at increasing N/P molar ratios. The minimum ratio for complete entrapment of siRNA was 2. The resulting complexes, which were characterized by a small diameter (similar to 30 nm) and positive surface charge, were able to protect siRNA from enzymatic degradation. Q-starch/siRNA complexes efficiently induced P-glycoprotein (P-gp) gene silencing in the human ovarian adeno-carcinoma cell line, NCI-ADR/Res (NAR), over expressing the targeted gene and presenting low toxicity. Additionally, Q-starch-based complexes showed high cellular uptake during a 24-hour study, which also suggested that intracellular siRNA delivery barriers governed the kinetics of siRNA transfection. In this study, we have devised a promising siRNA delivery vector based on a starch derivative for efficient and safe RNAi application. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Until recently cyanides were considered to be electrochemically non-reducible in aqueous solutions at mercury electrodes, but reducible at nickel, copper and silver electrodes. In our studies we noticed that the process is going on also at a renewable silver amalgam film electrode (Hg(Ag)FE). The electrochemical reduction of a novel fungicide with nitrile group, cyazofamid (Cfd) at the Hg(Ag)FE was studied for the first time. A rapid, sensitive, and new square-wave adsorptive stripping voltammetric (SWAdSV) method using a Hg(Ag)FE has been developed for the determination of Cfd. In order to understand the Cfd electrode mechanism, CV and SWAdSV techniques were applied. Cfd reduces at the Hg(Ag)FE with the cathodic signals being dependent on pH. The signal obtained at about -1.10V (citrate-phosphate (C-F) buffer, pH 2.6) was used for analytical purposes. Various parameters of the procedure, such as: pH, conditioning potential and time, frequency, amplitude, step potential, accumulation potential and time, were investigated. The developed SWAdSV method enabled Cfd determination in the concentration range of 4.00 x 10(-6)-2.00 x 10(-5) mol L-1. The procedure was successfully validated. The standard addition method was applied to determine Cfd in spiked Danube water and potato samples, and in the commercial formulation RANMAN Top. The effect of common interfering pesticides and heavy metal ions was also investigated. The adsorption of Cfd at the mercury electrode was studied. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Environment pollution by heavy metals is a global disaster and there are several cleaning methods including bioremediation. Trichoderma species inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi and play a useful role in agriculture and ecosystem management.
   Methods: In this study, the removing of cadmium ions by three species of Trichoderma (T. asperellum, T. harzianum and T. tomentosum) were studied under different pH (5, 7, 9) and different concentrations of Cd (1, 100, 200 ppm) in liquid media containing potato extract and dextrose. Above mentioned fungal strains were cultured in the Cd-polluted media and the remaining amount of metal ions in the media was measured after two months growth, using atomic absorption.
   Results: Results showed that all three fungal species were able to reduce the amount of Cd in the all three pH of the medias; but their removal ability varies depending on the species and cultural conditions. T. asperellum was showed maximum removal efficiency of cadmium (76.17%), (10.75 mg/g, at fungal dry weight). Based on our results, the most removal efficiency of Cd ions for the fungal species was evaluated in the alkaline pH.
   Conclusions: Trichoderma species are important fungi in decreasing of Cadmium ions. They have bioremediation potency under various pH and concentration conditions.

AB The target of natural selection is suggested to be the holobiont - the organism together with its associated symbiotic microorganisms. The well-defined endosymbiotic communities of insects make them a useful model for exploring the role of symbiotic interactions in shaping the functional repertoire of plants and animals. Here, we studied the variations in the symbiotic communities of the sweet potato whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) by compiling a dataset of over 2000 individuals derived from several independent screenings. The secondary endosymbionts harbored by each individual were clustered into entities termed Facultative Endosymbiont Combinations (FECs), each representing a natural assemblage of co-occurring bacterial genera. The association of FECs with whitefly individuals stratified the otherwise homogeneous population into holobiont units. We both identified bacterial assemblages that are specific to whitefly groups sharing unique genetic backgrounds, and characterized the FEC variations within these groups. The analysis revealed that FEC complexity is positively correlated with both distance from the equator and specificity of the genetic clade of the host insect. These findings highlight the importance of symbiotic combinations in shaping the distribution patterns of B. tat:go and possibly other insect species.

AB Background: This paper establishes empirical evidence relating the agriculture and health sectors in Uganda. The analysis explores linkages between agricultural management, malaria and implications for improving community health outcomes in rural Uganda. The goal of this exploratory work is to expand the evidence-base for collaboration between the agricultural and health sectors in Uganda.
   Methods: The paper presents an analysis of data from the 2006 Uganda National Household Survey using a parametric multivariate Two-Limit Tobit model to identify correlations between agro-ecological variables including geographically joined daily seasonal precipitation records and household level malaria risk. The analysis of agricultural and environmental factors as they affect household malaria rates, disaggregated by age-group, is inspired by a complimentary review of existing agricultural malaria literature indicating a gap in evidence with respect to agricultural management as a form of malaria vector management. Crop choices and agricultural management practices may contribute to vector control through the simultaneous effects of reducing malaria transmission, improving housing and nutrition through income gains, and reducing insecticide resistance in both malaria vectors and agricultural pests.
   Results: The econometric results show the existence of statistically significant correlations between crops, such as sweet potatoes/yams, beans, millet and sorghum, with household malaria risk. Local environmental factors are also influential-daily maximum temperature is negatively correlated with malaria, while daily minimum temperature is positively correlated with malaria, confirming trends in the broader literature are applicable to the Ugandan context.
   Conclusions: Although not necessarily causative, the findings provide sufficient evidence to warrant purposefully designed work to test for agriculture health causation in vector management. A key constraint to modeling the agricultural basis of malaria transmission is the lack of data integrating both the health and agricultural information necessary to satisfy the differing methodologies used by the two sectors. A national platform for collaboration between the agricultural and health sectors could help align programs to achieve better measurements of agricultural interactions with vector reproduction and evaluate the potential for agricultural policy and programs to support rural malaria control.

AB Fluazinam is a widely used pesticide employed against the fungal disease late blight in potato cultivation. A specific, repeatable, and rapid high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method utilizing a diode array detector (DAD) was developed to determine the presence of fluazinam in soil. The method consists of acetonitrile (ACN) extraction, clean-up with solid-phase extraction (SPE), and separation using a mobile phase consisting of 70% ACN and 30% water (v/v), including 0.02% acetic acid. HPLC was performed with a C18 column and the detection wavelength was 240nm. The method was successfully applied to an incubation experiment and to soil samples taken from potato fields where fluazinam had been applied two to three times during the on-going growing season. In the 90-day incubation experiment, analytical standard fluazinam and the commercial fungicide Shirlan((R)) were added to soil samples that had never been treated with fluazinam, and were then extracted with ACN and 0.01M calcium chloride (CaCl2). Fluazinam was not extractable with CaCl2, indicating that it does not leach to watercourses in the dissolved form. Recovery with ACN extraction for sandy soils was 72-95% immediately after application and 53-73% after 90days of incubation. Out of the eight potato field soil samples, fluazinam was found in two samples at concentrations of 2.1mg kg(-1) and 1.9mg kg(-1), well above the limit of quantification (0.1mg kg(-1)).

AB In this paper, a rapid and effective HPLC method, using tetraazacalix[2]arene[2]triazine-modified silica gel (NCSi) as solid-phase extraction (SPE) sorbent, was developed for the purification and determination of trace acrylamide in starchy foodstuffs. The main influence factors of SPE including amount of NCSi sorbent, sample flow rate, and volume and composition of washing solution were investigated and evaluated in the sample pretreatment step. The optimized purification effect was achieved at the sample flow rate of 3 mL/min with 100 mg of NCSi and 2 mL of washing solution (water, 100%). The HPLC separation was carried out on a C18 column (250 X 4.6 mm i.d., 5 mu m) with a mobile phase of methanol/water (10:90, v/v). The linear range of the calibration curve was 4-4000 ng/mL with s correlation coefficient of >0.9999. The intraday and interday RSDs (n = 5) of peak areas of acrylamide were 0.22 and 0.9096 and the intraday and interday RSDs (n = 5) of retention times were 0.50 and 1.63%, respectively. In addition, overall recoveries through the extraction and NCSi-SPE purification ranged from 73.13 to 98%. Compared with the commercial SPE sorbents, NCSi featured excellent selectivity to retain polar and nonpolar interferences in the sample matrices. The improved method was simple, rapid, accurate, and promising for the determination of trace acrylamide in starchy foods with a complex matrix.

AB All-population and area-based investigations of diet in central obesity are scarce. We used cross-sectional data from 50 339 individuals who responded to the HUNT3 survey of 2006-2008, which recruited from all county-residing adults 20 years and older, to investigate whether those with central obesity eat and drink differently than others. Answers to dietary questions were recoded and analyzed with multiple linear regression, using waist/hip ratio (WHR), age, and sex as explanatory variables. Frequencies of consumption or amounts of food, beverages, and meals were compared among WHR quartiles. Central obesity was present in the quartile with the highest WHR, WHR4(WHR >= 0.917 for women and 0.981 for men) but not in the quartile with the lowest WHR, WHR1 (WHR<0.817 for women and 0.895 for men). Dietary variables differed markedly by age and sex. After adjustment for these factors and for multiple testing, we found significant differences between WHR4 and WHR1 for 19 of 30 dietary variables. Central obesity was associated with a lower intake of any bread, and of whole-grain bread in particular. Intake of fruits and berries, vegetables, and pasta and rice was less, and intake of sausages and hamburgers and boiled potatoes was more frequent. Intake of alcohol, tea, and fruit juice was lower in those with central obesity, whereas intake of sugar-free soft drinks and coffee was higher. The frequency of breakfast and lunch was lower and of nightly meals was higher in those with central obesity. In conclusion, in this large area-based population, central obesity was associated with differences in dietary habits, some of which (such as decreased consumption of whole-grain bread and increased intake of sugar-free drinks) are of possible clinical significance.

AB Pectinolytic Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from different waterways in the UK and Finland. Three strains (174/2(T), 181/2 and Dw054) had the same 16S rRNA gene sequences which shared 99% sequence similarity to species of the genus Dickeys, and a phylogeny of related genera confirmed attribution to this genus. Fatty acid profile analysis of all three strains found a high proportion of C-16:1 omega 7c/C-16:1 omega 7c and C-16:0 fatty acids, and library profile searches found closest matches to Dickeya chrysanthemi. Production of a concatenated phylogeny using six loci, recA, gapA, atpD, gyrB, infB and rpoB, provided a high-resolution phylogeny which placed strains 174/2(T) and 181/2 as a distinct clade, separated from the other species of the genus Dickeya by a relatively long branch-length. DNA-DNA hybridization analysis with a limited number of reference species also supported the distinctiveness of strains 174/2(T) and 181/2 within the genus Dickeya. All three strains could be phenotypically distinguished from other species of the genus by fermentation of melibiose and raffinose but not D-arabinose or mannitol. The name Dickeys aquatica sp. nov. is proposed for the new taxon; the type strain is 174/2(T) (=NCPPB 4580(T)=LMG 27354(T)).

AB Penicillium ochrochloron Biourge, which was isolated from rotten sweet potato, can produce plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) with high viscosity reducing capability for ethanol production using fresh sweet potato tubers as feedstock. The enzyme preparation was characterized by a broad enzyme spectrum including 13 kinds of enzymes with the activity to hydrolyze cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, starch, and protein. The maximum viscosity-reducing capability was observed when the enzyme preparation was obtained after 5 days of fermentation using 20 g/L corncob as a sole carbon source, 4.5 g/L NH4NO3 as a sole nitrogen source, and an initial medium pH of 6.5. The sweet potato mash treated with the enzyme preparation exhibited much higher fermentation efficiency (92.58%) compared with commercial cellulase (88.06%) and control (83.5%). The enzyme production was then scaled up to 0.5, 5, and 100 L, and the viscosity-reducing rates were found to be 85%, 90%, and 91%, respectively. Thus, P. ochrochloron Biourge displays potential viscosity-reducing capability for ethanol production. (C) 2013 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB We studied the effects of landscape structure on species with resource nutritional partition between the immature and adult stages by investigating how food quality and spatial structure of a landscape may affect the invasion and colonization of the insect pest, Diabrotica speciosa. To this end, we formulated two bidimensional stochastic cellular automata, one for the insect immature stage and the other for the adult stage. The automata are coupled by adult oviposition and emergence. Further, each automata site has a specific culture type, which can affect differently the fitness attributes of immatures and adults, such as mortality, development and oviposition rates. We derived the mean-field approximation for these automata model, from which we obtained conditions for insect invasion. We ran numerical simulations using entomological parameters obtained from laboratory experiments (using bean, soybean, potato, and corn crops), and we compared the results of the automata with the ones given by the mean-field approximation. Finally, using artificially generated landscapes, we discussed how the structured heterogeneous landscape can affect dispersal and establishment of insect populations.

AB Effects of temperature and glycerol concentration on rheological properties of potato starch solutions were investigated. The flow behaviour (shear stress against shear rate) was fitted to various models: power law, Herschel-Bulkley, Bingham, modified Bingham and Casson models. However, it was found that the Herschel-Bulkley model describes better the flow behaviour observed at various temperatures and glycerol concentrations, for flow behaviour index values between 0.44 and 0.78, typical of pseudoplastic solutions. The effect of glycerol concentration on each of the fitting parameters for Herschel-Bulkley model was well modelled by a second-degree polynomial at various temperatures. The simultaneous influence of glycerol concentration and temperature on shear stress could be represented empirically by a second-degree polynomial function that includes linear coupling between concentration and temperature. Finally, the variation of the consistency coefficient with both temperature and glycerol concentration was well described by an exponential expression, with an activation energy value of 2.78 kJ mol(-1). The results indicate that both glycerol content and temperature have the effect of diluting potato starch solutions.

AB The dust explosion behaviors induced by two different combustion mechanisms (homogeneous and heterogeneous mechanisms) were comparatively investigated, based on the experiments under different dust concentrations, particle sizes and initial pressures in Siwek 20-L chamber. Based on the thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), sweet potato dust and magnesium dust were selected as the representative dusts with homogeneous and heterogeneous combustion mechanisms, respectively. Experiments find that these two dusts have different behaviors in the explosion kinetics due to different combustion mechanisms. For sweet potato dust, the explosion pressure P-max, the pressure rise rate (dp/dt)(max) and the combustion fraction eta exhibit similar variation trends as dust concentration increases and they all reach to the maximum values at the worst-case concentration; while for magnesium dust, the variation of (dp/dt)(max) is somewhat different from that of P-max, that is, the (dp/dt)(max) will achieve the maximum at the concentration higher than the worst-case and keep stabilized with further increase of dust concentration. As the particle size decreases, the (dp/dt)(max) for sweet potato dust will increasingly rise and gradually approach to a stabilized value, but for magnesium dust, the increase of (dp/dt)(max) becomes pronounced only in the range of smaller particle sizes. To account the effect of initial pressure on p(max) under different combustion mechanisms, a dimensionless pressure P-R was introduced to denote the relative intensity of explosion. It is found that, for sweet potato dust, the increased initial pressure will promote the explosion process (or with high P-R) for the dust cloud with high concentration due to the augmented oxygen concentration, but for the dust cloud with low concentration, the increased initial pressure will suppress the explosion process due to the increased resistance in devolatilization. For magnesium dust, the rise of initial pressure will generally promote the explosion process even for the dust cloud with low concentration; however, in the case of small particle size, the promotion of increased initial pressure to the explosion process is not so pronounced.

AB Red Monascus rice (Ang-kak) is used as a traditional medicine and a natural colorant for food and beverages. Starch isolated from waste Ang-kak may compete economically with other common starch and give new value to this waste. Isolation by using alkaline method gave a product with a starch content of 81%. Impurities in the product are protein, fiber, ash, and secondary metabolites of the Monascus rice. Several physicochemical properties of the isolated starch were also investigated. It was found that 88.03% of the isolated starch is amylopectin. Thermogravitation study showed that the isolated starch degraded only slightly at temperature below 230 C and can be considered as a new source of starch for various applications. c 2013 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The tobacco alpha-helical protein Nt-4/1 with unknown function forms ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes in vitro. Results obtained by retardation of RNP complexes in agarose gel were confirmed by Western-Northern hybridization. Several deletion and point mutants of Nt-4/1 were constructed, and the RNA-binding site was mapped in a positively charged region of the C-terminal domain of the protein. The results of this study and those described earlier support our hypothesis of the participation of Nt-4/1 protein in spreading RNA-containing pathogens in the plant.

AB We explored the interaction of iodine with three crystalline type starches, corn, potato, and sweet potato starches using atomic force microscopy. Results revealed that starch molecules aggregated through interaction with iodine solution as well as iodine vapor. Detailed fine structures such as networks, chains, and super-helical structures were found in iodide solution tests. The nanostructures formed due to iodine adsorption could help to understand the formation and properties of the starch-iodine complex. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Organic food products are believed to be healthier, safer and more environment-friendly than their conventional counterparts and are sold at premium prices. Consequently, adulteration of organic plants and fraudulent activities for economic profit are increasing. This has spurred the development of sophisticated analytical procedures for testing authenticity. We review the use of multi-element and stable-isotope analysis based on atomic spectroscopy for discriminating between organic and conventional plants. We conclude that inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, stable-isotope analysis of bulk plant tissue, and compound-specific isotope analysis based on isotope ratio-mass spectrometry are promising tools for documenting the fertilization history of organic plants. However, these techniques are challenged by the potential diversity of fertilization practices of organic and conventional plant production. We therefore recommend that analytical techniques are combined and coupled with chemometrics to develop statistical models that can classify the agricultural origin of plant products.

AB Three field experiments were carried out to assess the level of resistance of several cultivars to early blight (EB) and to examine the association between host resistance and either foliage maturity or tuber skin types. A total of 26 cultivars were used in Exps. 1 and 2, and 24 in Exp. 3. Plants were inoculated with isolates of Alternaria grandis at 31 days after planting. EB severity was quantified in each plot every seven days. The approach to determine the resistance levels of potato cultivars was based on multivariate analysis techniques. The tested cultivars responded as either resistant, moderately resistant, moderately susceptible or susceptible to EB. Most of the cultivars were classified as susceptible or moderately susceptible to EB. Resistant cultivars were mid-season, mid-late or late maturity. None of the susceptible cultivars were later maturity (mid-late or late maturity). In most cases, susceptible cultivars were earlier maturity (early or mid-early maturity). Most resistant cultivars had rough, mid-rough or smooth skin. None of the susceptible cultivars had rough skin. In most cases, susceptible or moderately susceptible cultivars had smooth skin. Obtaining potato cultivars that are resistant to this destructive disease will help reduce production costs and the need for costly fungicides.

AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the resistance of 30 Chilean potato landraces to natural infection by Phytophthora infestans during two growing seasons in Southern Chile. Control cultivars were 'Desiree', which has moderate susceptibility to late blight, and 'Karu', which is characterized by moderate resistance to the disease. The response of the potato landraces to late blight infection was assessed weekly by scoring the percentage of foliage destruction during the growing season. Subsequently, the relative area under the disease progress curve (AUDPCr) was calculated. A wide response variation was observed among the landraces during the occurrence of late blight. The comparative analysis of the AUDPCr showed that three landraces achieved high resistance to the disease (low AUDPCr values). These were UCT-34Cor (0.05), UCT-26Ach (0.06) and UCT-27Mu (0.10). Most of the potato landraces were classified into the range moderately resistant to moderately susceptible. The estimated values of heritabilities of the means were moderate to high for the joint analysis of the two years tested (0.65). The wide range of AUDPCr observed within potato landraces suggests the presence of partial resistance in response to the complex virulence pattern of the P. infestans populations present in Southern Chile.

   BEHAVIOR; SPREAD; PREFERENCE
AB Recent research suggests that plant viruses, and other pathogens, frequently alter host-plant phenotypes in ways that facilitate transmission by arthropod vectors. However, many viruses infect multiple hosts, raising questions about whether these pathogens are capable of inducing transmission-facilitating phenotypes in phylogenetically divergent host plants and the extent to which evolutionary history with a given host or plant community influences such effects. To explore these issues, we worked with two newly acquired field isolates of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-a widespread multi-host plant pathogen transmitted in a non-persistent manner by aphids-and explored effects on the phenotypes of different host plants and on their subsequent interactions with aphid vectors. An isolate collected from cultivated squash fields (KVPG2-CMV) induced in the native squash host (Cucurbita pepo) a suite of effects on host-vector interactions suggested by previous work to be conducive to transmission (including reduced host-plant quality for aphids, rapid aphid dispersal from infected to healthy plants, and enhanced aphid attraction to the elevated emission of a volatile blend similar to that of healthy plants). A second isolate (P1-CMV) collected from cultivated pepper (Capsicum annuum) induced more neutral effects in its native host (largely exhibiting non-significant trends in the direction of effects seen for KVPG2-CMV in squash). When we attempted cross-host inoculations of these two CMV isolates (KVPG2-CMV in pepper and P1-CMV in squash), P1-CMV was only sporadically able to infect the novel host; KVPG2-CMV infected the novel pepper host with somewhat reduced success compared with its native host and reached virus titers significantly lower than those observed for either strain in its native host. Furthermore, KVPG2-CMV induced changes in the phenotype of the novel host, and consequently in host-vector interactions, dramatically different than those observed in the native host and apparently maladaptive with respect to virus transmission (e. g., host plant quality for aphids was significantly improved in this instance, and aphid dispersal was reduced). Taken together, these findings provide evidence of adaption by CMV to local hosts (including reduced infectivity and replication in novel versus native hosts) and further suggest that such adaptation may extend to effects on host-plant traits mediating interactions with aphid vectors. Thus, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that virus effects on host-vector interactions can be adaptive, and they suggest that multi-host pathogens may exhibit adaptation with respect to these and other effects on host phenotypes, perhaps especially in homogeneous monocultures.

AB Research involving the use of nematophagous fungi in the biological control of parasites of interest to veterinarians has occurred over recent years, with promising results. This article reports the infection of Parascaris equorum eggs by the fungus Pochonia chlamydosporia (isolates VC1 and VC4). Six groups were formed for each isolate, with six different culture media: 2% water-agar (2% WA); agar-chitin (AC); YPSSA (yeast extract, K2HPO4, MgSO4 7H(2)O, soluble starch); AELA extract (starch+water+agar); 2% corn-meal-agar (2% CMA); and 2% potato dextrose-agar (2% PDA). A total of 1000 eggs of P. equorum were transferred to each plate containing isolates grown for a period of 7 days (treatment group). Also, 1000 eggs were added to each plate without fungus (controlgroup). The plates were kept in an environmental chamber at 25 degrees C in the dark for 21 days. After, we analyzed the effects on ovicidal activity: effect 1 (accession shell); effect 2 (penetration hyphae); and effect 3 (destruction of the eggs). No differences were observed in the destruction of eggs between the two isolates. The decreasing effectiveness of the different culture media was: PDA (38.9%); CMA (38.3%); WA (36.7%); YPSSA (36.45%); and AC (32.5%). The highest percentage egg destruction was observed when the strains were grown in culture medium AELA (44.9%); this was the best medium.

AB The journals of Captain Cook and his crew contradict bad-year economic theories that posit that traditional Hawaiian farmers were living at the margin. Recognising that pig herds were wealth-assets in old Hawai'i, an alternative good-year economic theory is developed that interprets the introduction of sweet potato and the development of the rain-fed agricultural systems in which it was cultivated as processes in the creation and management of wealth. The wealth produced in this way was probably used, in part, to promote marriage alliances among elite families. According to the good-year economic theory, fluctuations in the products of the rain-fed agricultural facilities introduced variability into the supply of wealth-assets, which complicated the maintenance of alliances and were one cause of the wars that played a crucial role in the emergence of primary states in traditional Hawai'i.

AB Imported Hawaiian Ti Cordyline plants (Cordyline fruticosa) 'Tipsy Pink' with anthracnose symptoms were found in Gainesville, FL, in 2013. A Colletotrichum spp. was isolated from symptomatic Cordyline plants and Koch's postulates were fulfilled. The colony color on acidified potato dextrose agar (PDA) was orange with slight shades of pink and light gray aerial mycelium. Sclerotia and setae were absent. Conidia were one-celled, hyaline, guttulate, and cylindrical with round ends. The mean size of the conidia was 14.7 x 5.0 mu m and ranged from 12.5 to 17.5 x 3.8 to 7.5 mu m. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on the internal transcribed space (ITS) and 28S rDNA regions of the isolate, and the sequences were compared with those of Colletotrichum spp. in GenBank. Sequence analysis indicated that the isolate belonged to C. cordylinicola. This is the first report of C. cordylinicola on C. fruticosa in Florida and the United States. Anthracnose symptoms developed on healthy-looking, latently infected Hawaiian Ti plants within 2 to 3 months, and 34% to 44% of the non-inoculated plants became diseased in 3 months. Reactions of several Dracaena and Cordyline species and varieties including Hawaiian Ti to C. cordylinicola were assessed. Several Dracaena and Cordyline species and varieties including Hawaiian Ti exhibited a differential response when inoculated with C. cordylinicola, but none of them was resistant. Hawaiian Ti was the most and lucky bamboo (Dracaena sanderiana) the least susceptible [area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) = 71 vs. 10 cm(2).d(-1)] to C. cordylinicola. The slope of the log-transformed disease progress regression line was steepest on Hawaiian Ti and D. marginata variety 'Colorama' plants, intermediate on varieties 'Tarzan' and 'Magenta', and least on lucky bamboo [slope = 0.046, 0.044, 0.036, and 0.034 vs. 0.020 log(cm(2) + 1)/d, respectively, with a mean SE of 0.0006].

AB Senescence-associated proteolysis in plants is a crucial process to relocalize nutrients from leaves to growing or storage tissues. The massive net degradation of proteins involves broad metabolic networks, different subcellular compartments, and several types of proteases and regulators. C1A cysteine proteases, grouped as cathepsin L-, B-, H-, and F-like according to their gene structures and phylogenetic relationships, are the most abundant enzymes responsible for the proteolytic activity during leaf senescence. Besides, cystatins as specific modulators of C1A peptidase activities exert a complex regulatory role in this physiological process.

AB Bis(2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl) ether (BDDE) is a bromophenol isolated from marine algae. Previous reports have shown that BDDE possesses cytotoxic and antibacterial activity. In the present study, we demonstrate that BDDE displays broad-spectrum antifungal activities, especially on Botrytis cinerea. BDDE inhibits the growth of B. cinerea cultured on a solid medium of potato dextrose agar (PDA) as well as on the potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium. Moreover, BDDE decreases the incidence of fruit decay and severity of strawberries infected with B. cinerea. Further studies have revealed that BDDE decreases the germination rate and inhibits the mycelial growth of B. cinerea. The inhibition mechanisms are related to the disruption of the cell membrane integrity in B. cinerea spores and newly formed germ tubes. This study also suggests that BDDE possibly interacts with DNA via intercalation and minor groove binding. The studies provide evidence that BDDE has potential application in the control of gray mold after fruit harvest and the compound could serve as a candidate or lead template for rational drug design and for the development of antifungal agents.

AB The metaflumizone, which belongs to the class of voltage-dependent sodium channel blockers, was registered to control Spodoptera exigua on vegetables in China in 2009. The present study revealed S. exigua has developed high resistance to this novel chemistry insecticide shortly after 2-3 years application in Guangdong Province of China. The metabolic mechanisms for metaflumizone resistance in this insect were analysed. The inhibitor of esterases greatly potentiates the toxicity of this chemical against the field resistant populations. The synergism ratio is 5.7 and 3.4-fold for S. exigua collected from Huizhou, Guangdong Province in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The activity of esterases in field populations (HZ12) is also significantly greater than that in the susceptible strain, and further significantly increased by challenge with metaflumizone for 3 generations. However, the inhibitor of P450s or GSTs only has slight synergism on metaflumizone toxicity against resistant populations, and there are no obvious differences in activities of P450s or GSTs between resistant populations and the susceptible strain. These results suggest that esterases might take pivotal role in conferring metabolic resistance to metaflumizone in the field populations of S. exigua, and P450s or GSTs are not involved in this resistance. Moreover, flavin-dependent monooxygenases (FMOs) are discovered to involve in metaflumizone resistance in the field populations of S. exigua. The FMO inhibitor, methimazole, potentiates metaflumizone toxicity in resistant larva of this species substantially. The synergism ratios for methimazole in resistant populations HZ11 and HZ12 were 3.1 and 1.9, respectively. Enzymatic assays also revealed higher FMO activities in resistant populations than in the susceptible strain, and successive selection with metaflumizone further increased the FMO activity in the field resistant population, but not significantly. The higher FMO activities in the older larval stages and in the larval midgut signify the importance of FMO in the detoxification of xenobiotic from food sources. The synergism assay and FMO activity analysis suggest that FMO contributes to metaflumizone detoxification in resistant populations of S. exigua and conferred metaflumizone resistance in S. exigua. A novel mechanism for insecticide resistance by insect was proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The dissipation patterns of thiamethoxam insecticide at two different rates (12.5 and 25 mu g/g) in both silty clay, loam and loam soils were studied. The half lives of thiamethoxam were in the range of 15.0 to 18.8 days in silty clay loam and 20.1 to 21.5 days in loam soil. The residues of thiamethoxam in potato tubers and soil at harvest time (90 days after planting) could not be detected either in soil or in tubers at any of the applied rates (25 and 50 g a.i./ha). Thus, thiamethoxam does not appear to pose any health hazard to consumers or harm to the environment.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of fresh-cut in stick form of two cassava cultivars on their biochemical and antioxidant characteristics, at two harvest times. The fresh cut cassava sticks were packaged in polypropylene, maintained at 5 +/- 1 degrees C, with 90 +/- 5% relative humidity for 12 days. The concentration of carotenoids, total soluble phenolic compounds and the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase and antioxidant capacity were significantly higher for the sticks of cultivar 'Amarela' cassava than for the sticks of cultivar 'Cacau'. The concentrations of carotenoids, total soluble phenolic compounds, and the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase and antioxidant capacity were all significantly greater when harvested at 14-month of age. There was a significant increase in the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase during the 12 days of storage at 5 degrees C. However; there was a decrease in total carotenoids, soluble phenolic compounds, and in the antioxidant capacity of the two cultivars.

AB CONSPECTUS: Host-guest chemistry commenced to a large degree with the work of Pedersen, who in 1967 first reported the synthesis of crown ethers. The past 45 years have witnessed a substantial progress in the field, from the design of highly selective host molecules as receptors to their application in drug delivery and, particularly, analyte sensing. Much effort has been expended on designing receptors and signaling mechanism for detecting compounds of biological and environmental relevance. Traditionally, the design of a chemosensor comprises one component for molecular recognition, frequently macrocycles of the cyclodextrin, cucurbituril, cyclophane, or calixarene type. The second component, used for signaling, is typically an indicator dye which changes its photophysical properties, preferably its fluorescence, upon analyte binding. A variety of signal transduction mechanisms are available, of which displacement of the dye from the macrocyclic binding site is one of the simplest and most popular ones. This constitutes the working principle of indicator displacement assays.
   However, indicator displacement assays have been predominantly exploited in a static fashion, namely, to determine absolute analyte concentrations, or, by using combinations of several reporter pairs, to achieve a differential sensing and, thus, identification of specific food products or brands. In contrast, their use in biological systems, for example, with membranes, cells, or with enzymes has been comparably less explored, which led us to the design of the so-called tandem assays, that is, dynamically analyte-responsive host-dye systems, in which the change in analyte concentrations is induced by a biological reaction or process. This methodological variation has practical application potential, because the ability to monitor these biochemical pathways or to follow specific molecules in real time is of paramount interest for both biochemical laboratories and the pharmaceutical industry.
   We will begin by describing the underlying principles that govern the use of macrocycle-fluorescent dye complexes to monitor time-dependent changes in analyte concentrations. Suitable chemosensing ensembles are introduced, along with their fluorescence responses (switch-on or switch-off). This includes supramolecular tandem assays in their product- and substrate-selective variants, and in their domino and enzyme-coupled modifications, with assays for amino acid decarboxylases, diamine, and choline oxidase, proteases, methyl transferases, acetylcholineesterase (including an unpublished direct tandem assay), choline oxidase, and potato apyrase as examples. It also includes the very recently introduced tandem membrane assays in their published influx and unpublished efflux variants, with the outer membrane protein F as channel protein and protamine as bidirectionally translocated analyte. As proof-of-principle for environmental monitoring applications, we describe sensing ensembles for volatile hydrocarbons.

AB Study objective: We report botulism poisoning at a state prison after ingestion of homemade wine (pruno).
   Methods: This is an observational case series with data collected retrospectively by chart review. All suspected exposures were referred to a single hospital in October 2011.
   Results: Twelve prisoners consumed pruno, a homemade alcoholic beverage made from a mixture of ingredients in prison environments. Four drank pruno made without potato and did not develop botulism. Eight drank pruno made with potato, became symptomatic, and were hospitalized. Presenting symptoms included dysphagia, diplopia, dysarthria, and weakness. The median time to symptom onset was 54.5 hours (interquartile range [IQR] 49-88 hours) postingestion. All 8 patients received botulinum antitoxin a median of 12 hours post-emergency department admission (IQR 8.9-18.8 hours). Seven of 8 patients had positive stool samples for type A botulinum toxin. The 3 most severely affected patients had respiratory failure and were intubated 43, 64, and 68 hours postingestion. Their maximal inspiratory force values were -5, -15, and -30 cm H2O. Their forced vital capacity values were 0.91, 2.1, and 2.2 L, whereas the 5 nonintubated patients had median maximal inspiratory force of -60 cm H2O (IQR -60 to -55) and forced vital capacity of 4.5 L (IQR 3.7-4.9). Electromyography abnormalities were observed in 1 of the nonintubated and 2 of the intubated patients.
   Conclusion: A pruno-associated botulism outbreak resulted in respiratory failure and abnormal pulmonary parameters in the most affected patients. Electromyography abnormalities were observed in the majority of intubated patients. Potato in the pruno recipe was associated with botulism.

AB Efficacy of Serratia marcescens for pigment production and biological activity was investigated. Natural substrates like sweet potato, mahua flower extract (Madhuca latifolia L.), and sesam at different concentrations were taken. As a carbon source microorganism favored potato powder was followed by sesam and mannitol, and as nitrogen source casein hydrolysate was followed by yeast and malt extract. The effect of inorganic salts on pigment production was also studied. At final optimized composition of suitable carbon, nitrogen source, and trace materials and at suitable physiological conditions, prodigiosin production was 4.8 g L-1. The isolated pigment showed antimicrobial activity against different pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Extracted pigment was characterized by spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and thin layer chromatography (TLC) which confirm production of biological compound prodigiosin. This study suggests that use of sweet potato powder and casein can be a potential alternative bioresource for commercial production of pigment prodigiosin.

Therefore, there is a need to develop an efficient method for the quick production of large amounts of homogeneous proteins with high catalytic activity. Expression of proteins in prokaryotic cells is the most common way for the protein production. The aim of our study was to develop a method of expression of potato apyrase (StAPY4, 5, and 6) genes in bacterial cells under conditions that allowed the production of catalytically active form of these enzymes. Apyrase 4 and 6 were overexpressed in BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) bacteria strain but they were accumulated in inclusion bodies, regardless of the culture conditions and induction method. Co-expression of potato apyrases with molecular chaperones allowed the expression of catalytically active apyrase 5. However, its high nucleotidase activity could be toxic for bacteria and is therefore synthesized in small amounts in cells. Our studies show that each protein requires other conditions for maturation and even small differences in amino acid sequence can essentially affect protein folding regardless of presence of chaperones.

AB Black scurf and stem canker disease cause by the fungal pathogen of Rhizoctonia solani and it is an economical important disease of potatoes in Bangladesh and throughout the world. This study evaluated the black scurf and stem canker disease development in potato and antagonistic activity of Trichoderma spp. against R. solani. The artificial infections were carried out using the inoculums of R. solani. The treatments (% inoculum) were: T1 (0% inoculum), T2 (5% inoculum), T3 (10% inoculum), T4 (20% inoculum), T5 (50% inoculum), and T6 (100% inoculum). The infection of stem canker and black scurf on progeny tubers increased with increase in inoculum levels. The highest disease incidence and severity was found in T6 (100% inocula). T6 showed the maximum black scurf infected tubers (russet, deformed and sclerotia). The lowest germination percentage, plant height and tuber yield were also obtained in th e same treatment (100% inocula). Trichoderma spp reduced the growth of R. solani and the highest growth suppression was noted in isolate TM12. According to antagonistic activity, Trichoderma spp. reduced the growth of R. solani but was not able to stop the pathogen development. This finding showed management of this disease or R. solani invasion requires an integrated approach compared to Trichoderma single approach.

AB The induction of nonreduced gametes, whether from first-division restitution (FDR), second-division restitution (SDR), or both, is an important approach for polyploidization. However, an accurate method for determining the genetic constitution of polyploid hybrids is not available. In this study, based on both flow cytometric analysis and somatic chromosome counting, 164 triploid hybrids of the female parent Populus pseudo-simonii x P. nigra 'Zheyin3#' (2n = 2x = 38, abbreviated ZY3) and male parent P. x beijingensis (2n = 2x = 38, abbreviated BJY) were produced by high-temperature treatment during ZY3 megasporogenesis. Using six simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers with low recombination frequencies to reduce the impact of recombination, we analyzed the allelic configurations of the obtained triploid hybrids. Although the allelic configurations were not always consistent at all six loci, by combining the allelic configurations at the six loci, we inferred that 40 triploids originated from FDR 2n eggs of ZY3, whereas the others originated from SDR 2n eggs. In conclusion, our study provides a novel and effective tool for analyzing 2n gametes and performing early selection to improve triploid poplar breeding programs.

AB The knock-out mutation of plastidial phosphoglucomutase (pgm) causes a starchless phenotype in Arabidopsis thaliana, and results in a severe growth reduction of plants cultivated under diurnal conditions. It has been speculated that high soluble sugar levels accumulating during the light phase in leaf mesophyll might cause a reduction of photosynthetic activity or that shortage of reduced carbon during the night is the reason for the slow biomass gain of pgm. Separate simultaneous measurements of leaf net photosynthesis and root respiration demonstrate that photosynthetic activity per unit fresh weight is not reduced in pgm, whereas root respiration is strongly elevated. Comparison with a mutant defective in the dominating vacuolar invertase (At beta Fruct4) revealed that high sucrose concentration in the cytosol, but not in the vacuole, of leaf cells is responsible for elevated assimilate transport to the root. Increased sugar supply to the root, as observed in pgm mutants, forces substantial respiratory losses. Because root respiration accounts for 80% of total plant respiration under long-day conditions, this gives rise to retarded biomass formation. In contrast, reduced vacuolar invertase activity leads to reduced net photosynthesis in the shoot and lowered root respiration, and affords an increased root/shoot ratio. The results demonstrate that roots have very limited capacity for carbon storage but exert rigid control of supply for their maintenance metabolism.

AB The effects of gamma irradiation and stearic acid, alone and in combination, on functional, structural, and molecular characteristics of high amylose maize starch (Hylon VII, approximate to 60% amylose) were studied. Stearic acid (0, 1.5, and 5%) was added to Hylon VII starch, and then irradiated at 0, 30, and 60 kGy. Gamma irradiation significantly (p <= 0.05) increased solubility, water absorption capacity, and oil absorption capacity as well as decreased swelling power (at 90 and 95 degrees C) of Hylon VII starch. These changes related well with increased amylose and decreased amylopectin content, decreased MW, and decreased transition endotherms of the starches due to gamma irradiation. Stearic acid addition significantly increased (p <= 0.05) water and oil absorption capacities, relative crystallinity as well as decreased solubility and swelling power of Hylon VII. Gamma irradiation had more effect on the molecular structure of Hylon VII compared with stearic acid. Gamma irradiation alone and with stearic acid did not seem to change the XRD pattern and microstructure of Hylon VII. The similar XRD pattern and morphology observed for irradiated and non-irradiated Hylon VII suggests that gamma irradiation depolymerizes amylose, and amylopectin mostly in the amorphous region of the starch to produce less branched or unbranched amylopectin. Gamma irradiation with stearic acid has potential in Hylon VII modification.

AB Peruvian carrot and cassava starches were isolated, adjusted to 30 and 35% moisture, and heated at 90 degrees C for 8 h. Structural and physicochemical characteristics of the treated starches were evaluated and compared. High performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detector (HPAEC-PAD), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and amylose content, revealed that the HMT did not change the chemical structures of the starches. A large agglomeration of granules was observed from SEM, particularly in the Peruvian carrot starch. Crystalline patterns in Peruvian carrot and cassava starches changed from B to C and CA to A, respectively. Relative crystallinity decreased from 30 to 25% in Peruvian Carrot starch, and increased from 35 to 37% in cassava starch adjusted to 30% moisture. SF and peak viscosity decreased, breakdown was almost completely eliminated (particularly in the Peruvian carrot starch), and final viscosity increased. WAI and WSI increased as moisture levels of both starches increased. Gelatinization temperatures increased and enthalpy decreased. Degrees of gelatinization increased as the moisture level increased, reaching 33 and 72% in the cassava and Peruvian carrot starches, respectively. HMT strengthened the intra-and intermolecular interactions of starches and increased their stability during heating and shearing, but also caused a partial gelatinization in the starches, particularly in Peruvian carrot starch.

AB The preparation method of starch-based films cross-linked with citric acid (CA) and containing microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) has been described. The addition of MCC improved mechanical properties of polysaccharide films. Young's modulus and tensile strength increased from 42 to 96 MPa and from 2.6 to 3.9 MPa, respectively, for unfilled starch/CA films and similar system containing 15 wt% MCC, respectively. Moreover, the presence of cellulose filler influenced the thermal properties of starch-based material: with increasing MCC content glass transition (tan delta) increased from 108 up to 129 degrees C, respectively, for unfilled system and containing 15 wt% MCC. Additionally, the hydrophilicity of starch-based films was reduced, as moisture absorption and solubility in water decreased. Novel application of reinforced biodegradable starch-based films as pressure sensitive adhesive carrier (for double-sided tapes used in paper industry) was successfully proposed.

SDS-PAGE indicated that high MW polypeptides eliminated during early stages of purification than low MW. The starches showed typical A-type XRD pattern along with increasing crystalline region after each successive purification stages. DSC evaluation showed the presence of two endotherms during heating, the first between 69.9 and 81.5 degrees C and second endotherm between 84.1 and 105.3 degrees C being associated with the melting of crystallites and amylose-lipid complexes, respectively. Transition temperatures decreased while gelatinization enthalpy increased with the purification of starch. During cooling, exotherms at peak temperature between 78.8 and 90.3 degrees C was observed. Peak viscosity, final viscosity, breakdown viscosity and setback increased while pasting temperature decreased after each successive purification stage. Storage modulus, syneresis and transmittance of starches revealed increased tendency towards retrogradation with decrease in protein content and lipid content.

AB The objective of the study was to assess the effect of soil fertilization with 280 and 420 kgNPK ha(-1) as well as foliar application of the fertilizers Basfoliar 12-4-6, ADOB Mn and Solubor DF on quality parameters of potato which belonged to three classes of earliness: medium-early (cultivar Adam), medium-late (cv. Pasja Pomorska) and late one (cv. Sleza). The scope of the research encompassed determinations of the content of starch and starch granulation, which were closely correlated with the potato cultivar and doses of mineral fertilizers applied to soil. An increase in the dose of the soil-applied fertilizer by 140 kg NPK ha(-1), including 40 kg more of N ha(-1), caused a decrease in the content of starch concurrently with a higher share of starch granules smaller than 20 mu m in diameter. The analysed plant material contained mostly large starch granules of the diameter >40 mu m. The foliar fertilizers did not have any significant effect on the examined parameters.

AB In this study, scanning electronic microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis were used in order to study the main characteristics of starch from green-banana, corn, potato, and cassava, and to analyze the process of thermal degradation of these starches. The Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and modified Coats-Redfern methods were used to determine the activation energy (E) of the degradation process, by using thermogravimetric data. These studies have shown that potato starch exhibited the highest activation energy values during the entire thermal degradation process while corn starch exhibited the lower values. Banana, corn, and potato starches showed that its activation energy was not dependent on the conversion extension, and therefore degradation corresponds to a simple process. In contrast, cassava starch showed that E was dependent of the conversion level, indicating that this degradation was more complex which involved more than one reaction. Potato and banana starches had higher values of the activation energy in its thermal degradation, which could be attributed to greater heterogeneity in granule sizes. Corn starch, which has small and homogeneous granules and major contents of the crystalline fractions, presented a lower activation energy in thermal degradation process.

AB The main gelatinization parameters of starches from three maize varieties with wide variation in amylose content (53, 30, and 20%) were obtained using DSC analysis. All starches were characterized by high lipid levels. Gelatinization temperature decreased with increasing amylose content both for native and treated (defatted and annealed) starches. For all studied starches irrespective of amylose content, A-type crystalline packing in semi-crystalline starch granules was observed as judged by the characteristic shift of starch melting temperature in 1 M KCl. Observed shifts of amylopectin melting temperatures to higher values in defatted starches were ascribed to the elution of lipids and/or lipid-containing complexes from crystalline lamellae. Two types of amylose-lipid complexes with different thermostability were detected in aqueous starch gels with concentration equal/more than 10%. It was suggested that the high level of lipids strongly contributed to the gelatinization properties of studied starches.

AB Starch isolated from Irish and sweet potatoes grown in Nigeria were characterized. The starch granules of Irish potato were larger (13.39-47.00 mu m) and showed a wider range of size distribution than sweet potato (2.00-25.86 mu m). There was significant difference (p < 0.05) in the moisture, nitrogen, fat, phosphorus, and amylose contents of the starches. Irish potato starch had a lower gelatinization peak temperature (64.2 degrees C) than sweet potato starch (74.9 degrees C) and exhibited higher swelling power and amylose leaching, lower pasting temperature, higher peak and lower setback viscosities. The shear stress-shear rate profiles indicated the starch pastes were non-Newtonian and could best be fitted to the Herschel-Bulkley model. Sweet potato starch paste exhibited a higher storage modulus than Irish potato starch paste. Irish potato starch paste showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher paste clarity and lower retrogradation than sweet potato. The starch properties dictate their food applications.

AB Starches obtained from the grains of white fonio (Digitaria exilis) and tubers of sweet potato (Ipomea batatas) have been modified by acid hydrolysis at different steeping times - (0, 24 and 96 h) and the physicochemical, material and compaction properties of the modified starches have been evaluated in comparison with official corn starch. The effect of acid modification on the compaction properties of the starches were evaluated with the aim of determining their usefulness as excipients in direct compression. The results showed that the physicochemical and material properties of the starches varied considerably depending on their botanical source. Acid modification led to an increase in solubility and relative crystallinity but decrease in swelling and viscosity of the starches. The effects were found to depend on the steeping time during acid hydrolysis. The results of the compressional properties indicated that the starches formed intact tablets at relatively low compression pressure with acid modified starches forming tablets with higher tensile strength than the natural starches. The results indicate that the physicochemical and compaction properties of white fonio and sweet potato starches were improved by acid modification yielding starches that could be suitable as directly compressible excipient.

AB Virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an effective technology for gene function analysis in plants. We assessed the VIGS effectiveness in Nicotiana benthamiana and citrus plants of different Citrus leaf blotch virus (CLBV)-based vectors, using insets of the phytoene desaturase (pds) gene. While in N. benthamiana the silencing phenotype was induced only by the construct carrying a 58-nt pds hairpin, in citrus plants all the constructs induced the silencing phenotype. Differences in the generation of secondary small interfering RNAs in both species are believed to be responsible for differential host-species effects. The ability of CLBV-based vectors to silence different endogenous citrus genes was further confirmed. Since CLBV-based vectors are known to be stable and induce VIGS in successive flushes for several months, these vectors provide an important genomic tool and it is expected that they will be useful to analyze gene function by reverse genetics in the long-lived citrus plants.

AB Despite positive nitrate (NO3-) concentration trends in surface waters and, to a lesser extent, ground waters, NO3- losses from agricultural soils in Europe must further decrease. A strict limitation of the nitrogen (N) fertiliser application rates is considered to be the best N management strategy to minimise NO3- losses to surface and ground water. This limitation, however, has also to be seen in view of plant N uptake characteristics.
   Yield and nitrogen dose response curves and residual soil mineral N (RSMN) contents at harvest were tested to scientifically substantiate fertilisation rates and limits. We re-analysed field experiments on cut grassland, silage maize, potatoes, sugar beets and winter wheat with various N fertiliser application rates at various locations in Flanders and northern Wallonia. The aim was to derive yield/crop N uptake and RSMN values at all N levels to derive optimum effective N fertiliser application rates for all of these crops. The relationship between yield/N uptake and effective N fertilisation rates were deduced from these N dose response curves. The RSMN was consistently low for cut grassland, sugar beets and winter wheat. For potatoes and silage maize, the maximum allowed N fertilisation rates resulted in relatively high RSMN. This puts a limit on the allowed N fertilisation rates for these crops.
   Minimising the RSMN whilst maintaining crop yields requires a correct understanding and quantification of all parameters of the soil mineral N balance (SMNB). The N dose response curves combined with RSMN values and all other factors of the SMNB during the cropping period allow to calculate the N surpluses. Furthermore, the N dose response curve, the RSMN and N surplus calculated for the cropping period give an indication of the efficiency of the applied effective N and can be used as a basis for a rational N fertilisation advice and maximum allowed N fertilisation rates.

AB Pullulan production by Aureobasidium pullulans CCTCC M 2012259 using rice hull hydrolysate as the carbon source was conducted. The acetic acid in the hydrolysate was demonstrated to exert a negative effect on pullulan biosynthesis. Instead of employing expensive methods to remove acetic acid from the hydrolysate, a mutant A. pullulans ARH-1 was isolated following 20 cycles of adaptive laboratory evolution of the parental strain on medium containing acetic acid. The maximum pullulan production achieved by the adapted mutant at 48 h using the hydrolysate of untreated rice hull was 22.2 g L-1, while that obtained by the parental strain at 60 h was 15.6 g L-1. The assay of key enzymes associated with pullulan biosynthesis revealed that acetic acid inhibited enzyme activity rather than suppressing enzyme synthesis. These results demonstrated that adaptive evolution highly improved the efficiency of pullulan production by A. pullulans using the hydrolysate of untreated rice hull. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As a species complex, Pseudomonas syringae exists in both agriculture and natural aquatic habitats. P. viridiflava, a member of this complex, has been reported to be phenotypically largely homogenous. We characterized strains from different habitats, selected based on their genetic similarity to previously described P. viridiflava strains. We revealed two distinct phylogroups and two different kinds of variability in phenotypic traits and genomic content. The strains exhibited phase variation in phenotypes including pathogenicity and soft rot on potato. We showed that the presence of two configurations of the Type III Secretion System [single (S-PAI) and tripartite (T-PAI) pathogenicity islands] are not correlated with pathogenicity or with the capacity to induce soft rot in contrast to previous reports. The presence/absence of the avrE effector gene was the only trait we found to be correlated with pathogenicity of P. viridiflava. Other Type III secretion effector genes were not correlated with pathogenicity. A genomic region resembling an exchangeable effector locus (EEL) was found in S-PAI strains, and a probable recombination between the two PAIs is described. The ensemble of the variability observed in these phylogroups of P. syringae likely contributes to their adaptability to alternating opportunities for pathogenicity or saprophytic survival.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This cross-sectional study aimed to estimate total antioxidant capacity (TAC) intake from food and beverages in a Japanese population from 7-day seasonal dietary records.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: The 7-day weighed dietary records of 390 subjects over four seasons between 1996 and 1998 were used. The TAC values (mu mol trolox equivalents (mu mol TE)/g) of various foods and beverages were defined, as reported in previous studies for weighed dietary records, using several different methods. TAC values of foods were estimated in 242 food and beverage items: 863% of vegetables, 99.1% of fruits, 71.5% of potatoes, 96.7% of beans, and 100% of chocolates. Differences in TAC intake per day and intake (g) per day among seasons in each of the food and beverage group were compared using a general linear model for repeated measures. The TAC intake/day were calculated for each food and beverage item in the four seasons.
   RESULTS: TAC intake/day (mu mol TE/day) varied from 10 189 (summer) to 12 292 (winter). TAC intake/day from fruits (2696) and potatoes (395) was highest in autumn, from vegetables (2827) it was highest in summer and from beans (4151) and tea (2331) it was highest in winter.
   CONCLUSIONS: The dietary habits of the studied Japanese population showed the highest antioxidant capacity in winter and the lowest in summer.

AB Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of obesity. Purple sweet potato color (PSPC) has potential anti-inflammation efficacy. We evaluated the effect of PSPC on kidney injury induced by high fat diet (HFD) and explored the mechanism underlying these effects. The results showed that PSPC (700 mg/kg per day) reduced body weight, ratio of urine albumin to creatinine, inflammatory cell infiltration, and Collagen IV accumulation in mice fed an HFD (60% fat food) for 20 weeks. PSPC significantly reduced the expression level of kidney NLRP3 inflammasome including NLRP3 and ASC and Caspase-1, and resulted in decline of IL-1 beta. Moreover, PSPC inhibited the activation of I kappa B kinase beta (IKK beta) and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kappa B). Additionally, PSPC decreased the expression level of oxidative stress-associated AGE receptor (RAGE) and thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) in the upstream of NLRP3 inflammasome. These data imply that the beneficial effects of PSPC on HFD-induced kidney dysfunction and damage are mediated through NLRP3 signaling pathways, suggesting a potential target for the prevention of obesity.

AB A solution culture experiment was conducted to evaluate the salinity tolerance of 15 tomato genotypes in Hoagland's nutrient solution with three levels of NaCl (0, 75, and 150 mM). The experiment was conducted in completely randomized design with three replicates. After 30 days of imposition of salt stress, gas exchange parameters including transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, CO2 assimilation rate, and intercellular CO2 concentration were recorded and the harvested plants were characterized for growth (shoot/longest root lengths and fresh/dry weights) and ionic characteristics (Na+, K+ and K+/Na+ ratio) parameters. All growth and gas exchange parameters decreased with increasing NaCl concentrations. However, this decrease was less in salt-tolerant genotypes as compared to salt-sensitive genotypes. It was also observed that with the increasing NaCl concentration in the rooting medium, the amount of Na+ in the plant tissues increased while the amount of K+ ion decreased. Thus, it was concluded that the plants with more K+ absorbing ability, with high K+/Na+ ratio, and higher growth were more salt-tolerant. Also, the results showed that fresh and dry weights, gas exchange characteristics, and K+/Na+ ratio were very effective in determining salt tolerance of tomato. Considering the genotypes, Indent-1 and Nagina were characterized as salt tolerant and the Red Ball and Peto-86 as salt sensitive under saline conditions.

TI Virulence and Resistance Gene Profiles of Staphylococcus aureus Strains
   Isolated from Ready-to-Eat Foods
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION
LA English
DT Article
AB Staphylococcal food poisoning represents the most prevalent foodborne intoxication worldwide. Oral intake of staphylococcal enterotoxins from food can result in emesis and diarrhea and can be fatal in children and the elderly. Few data have been available on the characteristics and sources of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from ready-to-eat (RTE) foods. In this study, we used a DNA microarray to determine virulence and antimicrobial resistance gene profiles of S. aureus from RTE foods. A total of 267 S. aureus strains isolated from 244 RTE foods were investigated. The isolates originated from precooked foods (41% of isolates), meat and fish products (17%), cheese (13%), delicatessen salads (8%), sandwiches and canapes (8%), confectionery and bakery products (6%), and various Other RTE foods (7%). Eleven samples (5%), of which 9 were raw milk cheeses, contained >10(5) CFU/g, which is considered a health risk. Four S. aureus strains were associated with intoxications; three cases were linked to consumption of cheese and one case was linked to consumption of potato salad. DNA microarray results revealed that one-third of the tested strains had at least one major enterotoxin gene (sea through see). We also detected the toxic shock syndrome gene (18% of isolates) and various genes conferring antimicrobial resistance, including genes involved in resistance to beta-lactams (blaZ, 72% of isolates), methicillin (mecA, 1% of isolates), and vancomycin (vanB, 1% of isolates). S. aureus strains were most frequently assigned to clonal complex (CC) 30 (17% of isolates), CC8 (12%), CC15 (11%), and CC45 (10%), which are commonly detected in humans colonized or infected with S. aureus. Although a large proportion of the tested food items contained milk, we did not detect CC705, the most prevalent clonal complex among S. aureus isolates from bovine mastitis milk. Our results suggest that S. aureus isolates from Rib foods do not commonly originate from animals but more likely come from food handlers who contaminate foods.

AB Soil rill erodibility (K-r) is an important parameter for process-based soil erosion models since it reflects the soil's ability to resist concentrated flow detachment. Detailed information on the temporal variability of Kr remains scarce but critical to accurately predict rill erosion. This study was conducted to investigate the temporal variations in K-r of a silt loam loess soil using the undisturbed topsoil samples collected from four typical croplands (corn [Zea mays L.], millet [Setaria italic], soybean [Glycine max], and potato [Solanum tuberosum L.]) and to further quantify the potential factors causing those changes in the Loess Plateau of China during one growing season from early April to late September of 2012. The results showed that the measured mean rill erodibility varied greatly with types of cropland. The potato land had the maximum mean K-r, and followed by corn, soybean, and millet. The K-r of the four croplands fluctuated considerably over time and tended to decline with root growth. Temporal variations in K-r were closely related to tillage operations, soil consolidation, water-stable aggregates, and root growth. The rill erodibility could be well predicted with root density, soil cohesion, and initial soil moisture content (NSE >= 0.82). Further studies are needed to detect the effects of root diameter of different plant types on rill erodibility.

AB Growers and sugar factories have to face new challenges in terms of sugar beet long time storage due to extension of the sugar beet campaign. Consequently, it is crucial to understand which primary factors are contributing to storage associated sugar losses. Due to a microbial colonization during storage, root rots develop, leading to sugar loss and accumulation of impurities. Besides well known plant pathogens (i.e. Aphanomyces cochlioides), many other storage pathogens have to be taken into account, such as wound pathogens (i.e. Fusarium spp.), saprophytes (i.e. Mucor spp.) and gum producing bacteria (i.e. Leuconostoc mesenteroides). The occurrence of these microorganisms depends heavily on the environment of cultivation. It is supposed that severe wounding, high amount of soil tare as well as warm and wet harvest conditions promote the development of root rots. The current control measures for root rots are focused on pile management. In addition, progress in sugar beet breeding and harvest techniques will give further possibilities to reduce the damage caused by root rots during storage. Therefore, it is the primary concern of this review to describe the major factors promoting the development of root rots and the impact on the storability of sugar beets. Furthermore, current control measures are presented and future prospects will be highlighted.

AB It is becoming increasingly evident that optimization of root architecture for resource capture is vital for enabling the next green revolution. Although cereals provide half of the calories consumed by humans, root and tuber crops are the second major source of carbohydrates globally. Yet, knowledge of root architecture in root and tuber species is limited. In this opinion article, we highlight what is known about the root system in root and tuber crops, and mark new research directions towards a better understanding of the relation between root architecture and yield. We believe that unraveling the role of root architecture in root and tuber crop productivity will improve global food security, especially in regions with marginal soil fertility and low-input agricultural systems.

AB Salinity is an important abiotic factor that limits plant growth and development. The influence of salt stress induced by sodium chloride on plant growth, proline content, level of lipid peroxidation and activities of antioxidative enzymes was studied in F1 hybrid DH10 and four dihaploid lines (207B, 238C, 239K, 244B) of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Dihaploids were obtained from anther-derived haploids of hybrid DH10 and were previously proved to be tolerant to Potato virus Y (PVY). In our study, plants were grown in vitro and exposed to NaCl (100 and 200 mM) for 33 days. All dihaploids and hybrid DH10 showed reduced growth after NaCl treatment. They accumulated significant amounts of sodium and proline in response to salt stress as have already been observed in tobacco and other plant species. In tobacco exposed to NaCl the lipid peroxidation level did not increase and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase and catalase (CAT) mostly did not change significantly. The exception was line 239K where salt induced higher activities of SOD, CAT and POD. Two (238C and 244B) out of four dihaploids appeared more susceptible to salt stress as they showed weak growth in correlation with high proline and sodium content. Therefore, it seems that salt tolerance is not associated with tolerance to PVY. Variations in malondialdehyde and proline content as well as in enzymes activities observed among tobacco lines imply that dihaploids have different genetic properties which might result in different sensitivity to NaCl.

AB Potato is one of the most important food crops in the world. Many plant transcription factors (TFs) have been demonstrated to be essential for improvement of plant stress tolerance traits. However, very few TFs were used for improving potato stress tolerance. In this study, we presented the characterization of a new potato StNAC2 gene. The StNAC2 protein contains five subdomains of NAC proteins and belongs to NAP subfamily. StNAC2 is constitutively expressed in potato leaves, stems, tubers, flowers and roots. Transcripts of StNAC2 were significantly induced by Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent pathogen of potato late blight. StNAC2 also could be induced by wounding, salt, drought as well as signal molecules such as salicylic acid and abscisic acid, suggesting that StNAC2 transcription factor involved in the signal transduction cascades in responses to abiotic and biotic stresses in potato. Overexpression of StNAC2 in transgenic potato significantly enhanced salt tolerance in vitro and drought tolerance in pot growing condition. Thus, the functional analysis of the new StNAC2 gene in this study will enrich knowledge for understanding the function of the NAC genes in potato stress tolerance.

AB An isolate of potato virus Y (PVY), PVY-M3, was subjected to biological characterization on potato indicators and to whole-genome sequencing. PVY-M3 induced a local and systemic hypersensitive resistance (HR) response in potato cultivar Maris Bard expressing the Nz gene while inducing no HR in potato cultivars Desiree and King Edward, carrying Ny and Nc genes, respectively. These HR responses, combined with a lack of vein necrosis in tobacco, clearly defined PVY-M3 as an isolate of the PVYZ strain. Recombination analysis demonstrated that PVY-M3 had a typical European PVYNTN genome with three recombinant junctions, and PVYN and PVYO were identified as parents.

AB Background: Applications of cell electropermeabilization are rapidly growing but basic concepts are still unclear. In particular, the impact of electric pulse repetition rate in the efficiency of permeabilization has not yet been understood.
   Methods: The impact of electric pulse repetition rate in the efficiency of permeabilization was analyzed in experiments performed on potato tissue and partially transposed on mice liver. On potato tissue, pulses with durations of 100 mu s or 10 ns are applied. The intensity of permeabilization was quantified by means of bioimpedance changes and electric current measurements and a new index was defined.
   Results: For the two pulse durations tested, very low repetition rates (below 0.1 Hz) are much more efficient to achieve cell permeabilization in potato tissue. In mice liver, using 100 mu s pulses, the influence of the repetition rate is more complex. Indeed, repetition rates of 1 Hz and 10 Hz are more efficient than 100 Hz or 1 kHz, but not the repetition rate of 0.1 Hz for which there is an impact of the living mice organism response.
   Conclusions: We propose that the effects reported here might be caused by an electroporation-induced cell membrane 'electro-desensitization' which requires seconds to dissipate due to membrane resealing. General significance: This study not only reinforces previous observations, but moreover it sustains a new concept of 'electro-desensitization' which is the first unifying mechanism enabling to explain all the results obtained until now both in vitro and in vivo, with long and short pulses.

AB As publicly available weather forecasting datasets advance in accuracy and spatial and temporal resolution, it is relatively simple to apply these established models to new datasets but the results may deviate from what users of decision support systems have come to expect. Potato late blight risk models were some of the earliest weather-based models. This analysis compares two types of potato late blight risk models that were originally trained on location specific (point) data in Michigan. A unique system using NoSQL was developed to train, validate and implement potato late blight risk modeling using a grid data format. Each model was tested two ways; it was first deployed directly with gridded weather forecasting data as a replacement for point data, and then retrained on the gridded data. Despite consistently lower overall accuracy, the grid trained artificial neural network model was deemed of better quality for use by stakeholders because of its accuracy on days with potato late blight risk. However, the success of the model was dependent upon its retraining using the newly available data source. In the direct implementation scenario without retraining, a simpler modified-Wallin model achieved better results than the neural network model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, sago starch was hydrolyzed by 0.14 M HCl for 6, 12, 18, and 24h, and then modified by propylene oxide at a concentration of 0-30% (v/w). The effects of hydrolysis and etherification on molecular weight distribution, physicochemical, rheological, and thermal properties of dually modified starch were estimated. Acid hydrolysis of starch decreased the molecular weight of starch especially amylopectin, but hydroxypropylation had no effect on the molecular weight distribution. The degree of Molar substitution (DS) of hydroxypropylated starch after acid hydrolysis ranged from 0.007 to 0.15. Dually modified starch with a DS higher than 0.1 was completely soluble in cold water at up to 25% concentration of the starch. This study shows that hydroxypropylation and hydrolysis have synergistic effects unlike individual modifications. Dually modified sago starch can be applied to dip-molding for food and pharmaceutical processing because of its high solubility and low tendency for retrogradation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study the influence of coating with different hydrocolloids on the oil absorption and quality attributes of French fries was investigated. Our results revealed that hydrocolloid coatings reduced the moisture loss during frying, and hence, reduced the oil uptake of French fries. Among the studied gums as a single layer coating, combination of carboxy methyl cellulose and pectin (0.5 and 1% w/w) lead to the lowest oil uptake of French fries. In samples coated with two and three-layer hydrocolloids, the oil absorption reduced further and the moisture content of final products was higher than the blank samples.

AB The anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity of kernels from 12 genotypes of waxy corn at two maturation stages (milk and mature) were investigated. The individual anthocyanins contained in coloured waxy corn were identified and quantified by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS analysis. Cyanidin-3-glucoside and its derivatives were detected as being most dominant. Furthermore, acylated anthocyanins constituted 67.1-88.2% and 46.2-83.6% of the total contents at the milk and mature stages, respectively. The concentration of monomeric anthocyanin increased throughout the development of each genotype of corn. The antioxidant activity, which was determined by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging ability, increased with ripening. However, the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) revealed decreases in some genotypes during ripening. The kernels of a purplish black waxy corn genotype (KKU-WX111031) exhibited the greatest antioxidant activity and contained the highest level of anthocyanins among the genotypes tested at both maturation stages.

AB Noble blended oils (canola: palm oil = 3:7, 4:6, 5:5, 6:4 and 7:3) were prepared and their frying qualities were evaluated. Frying qualities such as fatty acid composition, acid value, peroxide value, viscosity, smoke point, color, antioxidant activity, and sensory evaluation were measured to elucidate the optimum blend ratio of canola and palm oil. The ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acid of the blended oils was higher than that of palm oil after frying 50 times. The blended oil (3:7, Ca: Pa) had a relatively high oxidative stability and its peroxide values were 44.2-70.7 meq/kg after frying. The 3:7 (Ca: Pa) blended oil had excellent flavor, taste, and texture compared to those of the other frying oils as a result of a sensory evaluation of raw and fried potatoes. The results suggest that the 3:7 (Ca: Pa) blended oil is a good alternative oil for frying potatoes.

AB A high-nervonic acid (cis-15-tetracosenoic acid, C-24:1, n-9)-producing filamentous fungus of the Mortierella species was discovered among soil filamentous fungi. The filamentous fungal strain -RD000969- was isolated from soil collected in Kanagawa Prefecture (Japan) and was found to accumulate nervonic acid at a rate of 6.94% of the total cellular fatty acids. The base sequences of 28S rDNA D1/D2 and ITS 5.8S rDNA showed 100% homology with Mortierella capitata CBS 293.96. In addition to nervonic acid, strain RD000969 produced a large amount of long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (C-20:1, 12.22%; C-22:1, 4.07%; C-26:1, 5-91%) and a small amount of ultra-long-chain fatty acids (C-28:1, 0.44%; C-30:1, 0.06%; C-32:1, trace). In the fungal cells, 98.87% of nervonic acid was localized at the sn-1,3 position of triacylglycerol. Nervonic acid production was maximum (186.3 mg center dot L-1) when the fungus was cultured in potato dextrose (PD) medium containing yeast extract, CaCl2, and MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O.

AB The chemical composition of the volatile oil extracted from the aerial parts of Brassica rapa cv. "yukina" was analyzed using GC-MS, GC-PFPD, and GC-O. A total of 50 compounds were identified. The most prominent constituents were (E)-1,5-heptadiene (40.27%), 3-methyl-3-butenenitrile (25.97%) and 3-phenylpropanenitrile (12.41%). With regard to aroma compounds, 12 compounds were identified by GC-O analysis. The main aroma-active compounds were dimethyl tetrasulfide (sulphury-cabbage, FD = 64), 3-phenylpropanenitrile (nutty, FD = 64), 3-methylindole (pungent, FD = 64), and methional (potato, FD = 32). The antioxidant activity of the aroma-active compounds of the oil was determined using an oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay using fluorescein as the fluorescent probe. The ORAC values were found to be 785 67 trolox equivalents (mu mol TE/g) for B. rapa cv. "yukina" oil. The results obtained showed that the volatile oil extracted from the aerial parts is a good dietary source of antioxidants.

AB Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the bacterial expressed fused coat proteins (CPs) of Potato virus Y (PVY) and Potato virus X (PVX). Truncated CP sequences of PVY (similar to 246 bp) and PVX (similar to 243 bp) were amplified by PCR, cloned into T&A cloning vector and subsequently mobilized in a protein expression vector pET-28b (+). The recombinant CP was expressed as a fusion protein (similar to 20 kDa) with His-tag and purified from E. coli BL21 (DE3) using His-Bind resin. The specificity of the recombinant protein was confirmed by Western blot using previously made polyclonal antibodies against each virus. Polyclonal antibodies developed against the fused CPs in rabbit detected natural infection of PVY and PVX in potato leaf samples collected from IARI experimental farm, by direct antigen-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAC-ELISA).

TI Relationship Between Oil Uptake and Water Content During Deep-Fat Frying

ID STRUCTURAL-CHANGES; KINETICS; SLICES
AB The purpose of this study is to correlate water content and oil uptake with the structural changes of potato particulates during deep-fat frying. Raw potato particulates were sliced to form cylinders of 0.006 m diameter x 0.006 m length and subjected to deep-fat frying at isothermal oil temperatures of 160, 190 and 220 A degrees C. The microstructure properties were assessed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Previous results showed that a simultaneous two first-order kinetic model adequately predicted water loss of potato particulates during isothermal frying. In this study, a simple rational model with two parameters in which regression squared (Rsqr) reaches 0.983 shows that oil uptake can be expressed by water content. The cross-sectional structure of potato particulates observed using FESEM is different from the surface structure. Regardless of the frying temperature, pores not only become larger but also increase in number after the transition time. The observations of structural changes at the surface and inner section of potato particulates through the pictures of FESEM are critical. This physical evidence supports our previous assumption that the mechanisms of water loss (two-stage rate processes) before and after transition time are different.

AB In this study the potential of infrared (IR) spectroscopy for the classification of Colletotrichum coccodes (C coccodes) isolates into vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) was evaluated. Isolates which belong to the same VCG may have similar pathological and physiological traits that differ from those that are not assigned to the same VCG. Early classification of isolates into VCGs is of a great importance for a better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease and improves its control.
   The main goal of the present study was to classify 14 isolates of C. coccodes into VCGs and differentiate between them, based on their IR absorption spectra as obtained by the FTIR-ATR sampling technique. Advanced statistical and mathematical methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), were applied to the spectra after manipulation. The results show that it is possible to assign the isolates into VCGs with more than 90% success based on the wavenumber low region (1800-800 cm(-1)) and using 15 PCs. However, on the isolate level, the best differentiation results were obtained using PCA (15 PCs) and LDA for the combined regions (2990-2800 cm(-1), 1800-800 cm(-1)), with identification success rates of 87.2%.

AB Phenolics are implicated in the defence strategies of many plant species rendering their concentration increase of putative practical interest in the field of crop protection. Little attention has been given to the nature, concentration and distribution of phenolics within vegetative organs of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum. L) as compared to fruits. In this study, we extensively characterized the phenolics in leaves, stems and roots of nine tomato cultivars using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSn) and assessed the impact of low nitrogen (LN) availability on their accumulation. Thirty-one phenolics from the four sub-classes, hydroxycinnamoyl esters, flavonoids, anthocyanins and phenolamides were identified, five of which had not previously been reported in these tomato organs. A higher diversity and concentration of phenolics was found in leaves than in stems and roots. The qualitative distribution of these compounds between plant organs was similar for the nine cultivars with the exception of Micro-Tom because of its significantly higher phenolic concentrations in leaves and stems as compared to roots. With few exceptions, the influence of the LN treatment on the three organs of all cultivars was to increase the concentrations of hydroxycinnamoyl esters, flavonoids and anthocyanins and to decrease those of phenolamides. This impact of LN was greater in roots than in leaves and stems. Nitrogen nutrition thus appears as a means of modulating the concentration and composition of organ phenolics and their distribution within the whole plant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) is a key enzyme for glycine betaine synthesis, which plays an important role in improving plant tolerance to salinity. Until now, little is known about the molecular biology of BADH gene in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.). Here, we report the cloning, sequencing, and expression of IbBADH gene of sweet potato. The sequencing results showed that IbBADH contains a 1509 bp open reading frame coding for a protein of 502 amino acid residues. It is also found that there are three highly homologous isoforms (identity > 99%) of IbBADH in sweet potato. The results from both digital gene expression profiling and semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the expression levels of IbBADH were different among various tissues and development stages under natural condition and salt stress.

AB Effects of 50 mu M salicylic acid (SA) and 0.1 mu M jasmonic acid (JA) on the transcriptional activity of the genes encoding isoperoxidase (M21334) and PR-1 and PR-6 proteins during the development of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) defense response to Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary were investigated. The considerable accumulation of transcripts of peroxidase M21334 gene occurred in infected plants treated with JA together with SA or after SA, but not in the case of SA after JA. A decrease of the area of lesions induced by P. infestans on potato leaves treated with these compounds is one of the indications of their stimulatory effects on plant immunity. The obtained data suggest that plant resistance to the late blight is regulated via systemic induced resistance where JA plays an important role as an intermediate on conditions of active regulatory participation of SA.

AB Background: Vegetarian diets have been associated with reduced mortality. Because a pure vegetarian diet might not easily be embraced by many individuals, consuming preferentially plant-derived foods would be a more easily understood message. A provegetarian food pattern (FP) emphasizing preference for plant-derived foods might reduce all-cause mortality.
   Objective: The objective was to identify the association between an a priori defined provegetarian FP and all-cause mortality.
   Design: We followed 7216 participants (57% women; mean age: 67 y) at high cardiovascular risk for a median of 4.8 y. A validated 137-item semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire was administered at baseline and yearly thereafter. Fruit, vegetables, nuts, cereals, legumes, olive oil, and potatoes were positively weighted. Added animal fats, eggs, fish, dairy products, and meats or meat products were negatively weighted. Energy-adjusted quintiles were used to assign points to build the provegetarian FP (range: 12-60 points). Deaths were confirmed by review of medical records and the National Death Index.
   Results: There were 323 deaths during the follow-up period (76 from cardiovascular causes, 130 from cancer, 117 for noncancer, noncardiovascular causes). Higher baseline conformity with the provegetarian FP was associated with lower mortality (multivariable-adjusted HR for >= 40 compared with <30 points: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.88). Similar results were found with the use of updated information on diet (RR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.89).
   Conclusions: Among omnivorous subjects at high cardiovascular risk, better conformity with an FP that emphasized plant-derived foods was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality. This trial was registered at www.controlled-trials.com as ISRCTN35739639.

AB There is a considerable interest in trying to understand how aphids find their host plants because they are a major cause of economic losses in agricultural and horticultural production systems. Indeed, the specific behavioural sequences during host finding by aphids are one of the main reasons for their prominent role as vectors of plant pathogenic viruses. This paper reviews the visual and olfactory stimuli involved in host-finding behaviour of aphids, both basic and applied aspects are covered. Although controlling aphids by manipulation of visual and olfactory stimuli involved in host finding and host selection can be highly successful, as shown by research, most of these measures can still be further optimised and adoption in practice is currently limited. Research therefore needs to address some critical open questions, including ( a) the effects of visual contrasts on aphid behaviour; (b) the specific responses of aphids to ultraviolet (UV) light during different stages in host finding; ( c) the quantification of behavioural sequences in the field and (d) the response of aphid behaviour to plant diversity at varying spatial scales; further, ( e) a much more comprehensive coverage of aphid taxa and aphid ecological groups is needed in host-finding related research to uncover ecological principles underlying this critical behaviour.

AB Streptomyces scabies causes yield losses in potato by inducing common scab (CS) symptoms on tubers. Little information is available on global gene expression responses in CS-causing streptomycetes upon interaction with host plants. In this study, expression of 8746 genes was analysed in the type strain of S. scabies (ATCC49173) using a custom-designed, gene-specific oligonucleotide microarray. Bacteria were grown in liquid yeast malt extract (YME) medium and 480 genes were found to be up-regulated 24 h after supplementing the cultures with potato microtubers. Quantitative PCR analysis of eight putative or known virulence genes was consistent with the microarray data. Elevated expression of the thaxtomin synthesis gene txtA and txtR genes regulating synthesis of thaxomin A, the main pathogenicity factor of S. scabies, and production of thaxtomin A were detected in cultures containing microtubers. Unexpectedly, thaxtomin was also detected in cultures lacking microtubers, which indicated that growth in YME induces thaxtomin production in S. scabies. Many but not all microtubers incubated in the cultures of S. scabies for 48 h displayed symptoms, indicating that the microtubers were not equally susceptible even though they were produced under uniform in vitro growth conditions. These factors may have limited the differences in gene expression observed between S. scabies exposed to microtubers compared to controls. This study provides some of the first results on the transcriptome of S. scabies, a widely distributed and important potato pathogen, upon exposure to young developing potato tubers. The findings will inform future studies on interactions of CS-inducing streptomycetes with potato and means to control the disease.

AB Phosphorus (P) fertilizer can potentially serve as a source for Se accumulation in croplands. Furthermore, it has been reported that the addition of P fertilizer to soil may enhance Se availability. Japanese agricultural soils are typically enriched in P as a result of long-term, excessive P fertilization. Therefore, we conducted a three-year field experiment in order to evaluate the effect of P fertilization on the Se content of soils and crops. Potato, wheat and barley were cultivated with and without P fertilization at two field sites in Hokkaido (northern Japan) with different levels of historical P accumulation. The first field site consisted of an Andosol soil with low available P and the second site, a Cambisol soil with high available P. The three years of continuous P fertilization over the course of the experiment did not result in a significant increase in the Se content of soils or plants. The Se content of soils and plants, however, was higher in soil samples from the Cambisol field site than from the Andosol field site, and total soil Se was significantly correlated with available soil P. Soluble soil Se and the soil-plant transfer factor for Se were not affected by P fertilization. Thus, we concluded that the higher plant Se content at the Cambisol field site was primarily due to the higher levels of accumulated Se in the soil at the site and that historical excess P fertilization typical of agricultural soils in Japan contributes to increased Se uptake by crops.

AB There is an increased interest in secondary plant metabolites, such as polyphenols and carotenoids, due to their proposed health benefits. Much attention has focused on their bioavailability, a prerequisite for further physiological functions. As human studies are time consuming, costly, and restricted by ethical concerns, in vitro models for investigating the effects of digestion on these compounds have been developed and employed to predict their release from the food matrix, bioaccessibility, and assess changes in their profiles prior to absorption. Most typically, models simulate digestion in the oral cavity, the stomach, the small intestine, and, occasionally, the large intestine. A plethora of models have been reported, the choice mostly driven by the type of phytochemical studied, whether the purpose is screening or studying under close physiological conditions, and the availability of the model systems. Unfortunately, the diversity of model conditions has hampered the ability to compare results across different studies. For example, there is substantial variability in the time of digestion, concentrations of salts, enzymes, and bile acids used, pH, the inclusion of various digestion stages; and whether chosen conditions are static (with fixed concentrations of enzymes, bile salts, digesta, and so on) or dynamic (varying concentrations of these constituents). This review presents an overview of models that have been employed to study the digestion of both lipophilic and hydrophilic phytochemicals, comparing digestive conditions in vitro and in vivo and, finally, suggests a set of parameters for static models that resemble physiological conditions.

   ACTIVITY
AB The effects of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on humans and biodiversity are multiple and varied. Nowadays environmentally-friendly pesticides are strongly preferred to POPs. It is noteworthy that the crop protection role of pesticides and other techniques, i.e. biopesticides, plant extracts, prevention methods, organic methods, evaluation of plant resistance to certain pests under an integrated pest management (IPM), could improve the risks and benefits which must be assessed on a sound scientific basis. For this directive it is crucial to bring about a significant reduction in the use of chemical pesticides, not least through the promotion of sustainable alternative solutions such as organic farming and IPM. Biopesticides are derived from natural materials such as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals. Most of them are biodegradable in relatively short periods of time. On this regard, substances from Calceolaria species emerge as a strong alternative to the use of POPs. The American genus Calceolaria species are regarded both as a notorious weeds and popular ornamental garden plants. Some have medicinal applications. Other taxa of Calceolaria are toxic to insects and resistant to microbial attack. These properties are probably associated with the presence of terpenes, iridoids, flavonoids, naphthoquinones and phenylpropanoids previously demonstrated to have interesting biological activities. In this article a comprehensive evaluation of the potential utilization of Calceolaria species as a source of biopesticides is made. The chemical profile of selected members of the Chilean Calceolaria integrifolia sensu lato complex represents a significant addition to previous studies. New secondary metabolites were isolated, identified and tested for their antifeedant, insect growth regulation and insecticidal activities against Spodoptera frugiperda and Drosophila melanogaster. These species serve as a model of insect pests using conventional procedures. Additionally, bactericidal and fungicidal activity were determined. Dunnione mixed with gallic acid was the most active fungistatic and fungicidal combination encountered. Several compounds as isorhamnetin, combined with ferulic and gallic acid quickly reduced cell viability, but cell viability was recovered quickly and did not differ from that of the control. The effect of these mixtures on cultures of Aspergillus niger, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, was sublethal. However, when fungistatic isorhamnetin and dunnione were combined with sublethal amounts of both ferulic and gallic acid, respectively, strong fungicidal activity against theses strains was observed. Thus, dunnione combined with gallic acid completely restricted the recovery of cell viability. This apparent synergistic effect was probably due to the blockade of the recovery process from induced-stress. The same series of phenolics (iridoids, flavonoids, naphthoquinones and phenylpropanoids) were also tested against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Salmonella typhi, and agaisnt the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Sarcinia lutea, and Staphyllococcus aureus and their effects compared with those that of kanamycin. Mixtures of isorhamnetin/dunnione/kaempferol/ferulic/gallic acid in various combinations were found to have the most potent bactericidal and fungicidal activity with MFC between 10 and 50 mu g/ml.
   Quercetin was found to be the most potent fungistatic single compound with an MIC of 15 mu g/ml. A time-kill curve study showed that quercetin was fungicidal against fungi assayed at any growth stage. This antifungal activity was slightly enhanced by combination with gallic acid. The primary antifungal action of the mixtures assayed likely comes from their ability to act as nonionic surfactants that disrupt the function of native membrane-associated proteins. Hence, the antifungal activity of isorhamnetin and other O-methyl flavonols appears to be mediated by biophysical processes. Maximum activity is obtained when the balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions of the molecules of the mixtures becomes the most appropriate. Diterpenes, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, iridoids and phenolic acids were identified by chromatographic procedures (HPLC-DAD), ESI-MS, and NMR hyphenated techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB In the lowlands of Central Asia, summer grown potato is increasingly affected by soil moisture deficit due to inadequate irrigation and high evaporative demand. Many farmers cannot apply irrigation schedules that fully respond to the water demand because of reduced water availability throughout the Aral Sea basin, caused by global warming, and the competing use of irrigation by the cotton crop. The effects of different irrigation regimes were evaluated on ten potato clones in the lowlands of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, during the summer cropping season (July October) of three consecutive years (2008, 2009 and 2010). The applicability of a growth model to predict yield under the different water regimes was tested. Significant treatment and genotype effects on yield and yield components were observed. The significant correlation for tuber yield among treatments suggested that yield under water limitation was driven more by potential yield than water restriction tolerance. Tuber yield was more associated to tuber weight than to tuber number, a component already largely determined when the different water treatments were initiated. The reduction of water supply after tuberization had a limited effect on yield and consequently drastically enhanced water use efficiency. It increased starch and dry matter content, but decreased vitamin C content. Some clones maintained high yield across years and treatments and appeared as good candidates for being recommended to farmers. Others showed interesting quality traits and are proposed for use as progenitors in breeding programs targeting at the improvement of the nutritional value of potato. A good prediction of yield was obtained using the growth model except for year 2009 when trials were heavily affected by weed infestation. The present study contributes to the improvement of water management and the identification of clones with high tuber yield and quality for the lowlands of Tashkent. Additional experiments are required to address the constraints to potato cultivation in other agro-climatic zones of Central Asia. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Four samples of paper and board (P/B) of a type used for packaging dry foods were subjected to migration tests using mushrooms, apples, potatoes and bananas, and using the polymeric powder Tenax T as a food simulant. The P/B samples contained only low levels of diisopropylnaphthalene (DiPN) and diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) and so the experiments were conducted after impregnating the P/B with added model substances. These were o-xylene, acetophenone, dodecane, benzophenone, DiPN and DiBP. Migration levels depended strongly on the nature of the substance and on the nature of the food and much less on the characteristics of the P/B, except insofar as they affected the contact area - flexible papers giving more extensive contact with the food than thick rigid board. Migration into Tenax T was at least a factor of 10 higher than migration into the fresh fruit and vegetables. The food samples were placed in contact with the P/B and then overwrapped loosely with aluminium foil and so this correction factor will tend to be conservative compared with a more open storage of the packed foods. Washing, peeling or cooking the fruits and vegetables after contact with the P/B had a surprisingly small effect on contaminant levels in general, and no one processing step was effective in giving a significant reduction of all the types of chemicals studied. This was because either they had penetrated into the food (so resisting peeling), or were not freely water-soluble (so resisting washing) or were not particularly volatile (so resisting loss by evaporation during cooking).

AB Flour recovered from broken rice noodles was evaluated by microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, differential scanning calorimetry, in vitro starch digestibility, pasting and gel texture analyses. Rice noodle making processes destroyed the granular and crystalline structures of rice flour (RF), but the process-induced recrystallised amylopectin and amylose-lipid complexes were observed. Higher level of resistant starch in broken rice noodle flour (BRNF) was due to the retrograded amylose, which formed during noodle making. The absence of pasting temperature and low pasting viscosity of BRNF were distinct from those of RF, whereas gel textures of both flours were similar. BRNF-added rice noodles showed lower hardness, but the other cooking and texture qualities were close to the one without BRNF. Up to 17% of BRNF could be incorporated into composite rice noodle making. This study thus provided an approach to the management and utilisation of food processing wastes.

AB The effect of the PPh3 group in the antitumor activity of some new organometallic ruthenium(II) complexes has been investigated. Several complexes of the type [Ru-(II)(Cl)(PPh3)(Lig-N)], [Ru-(II)(Cl)(2)(Lig-N)] (where Lig-N = pyridine derivate) and [Ru-(II)(Cl)(PPh3)(2)], have been synthesized and characterized. A noticeable increment of the antitumor activity and cytotoxicity of the complexes due to the presence of PPh3 moiety has also been demonstrated, affording IC50 values of 5.2 mu M in HL-60 tumor cell lines. Atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism and electrophoresis experiments have proved that these complexes can bind DNA resulting in a distortion of both secondary and tertiary structures. Ethidium bromide displacement fluorescence spectroscopy studies and viscosity measurements support that the presence of PPh3 group induces intercalation interactions with DNA. Indeed, crystallographic analysis, suggest that intra-molecular pi-pi interactions could be involved in the intercalation within DNA base pairs. Furthermore, high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) studies have confirmed a strong interaction between ruthenium complexes and proteins (ubiquitin and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor - PCI) including slower kinetics due to the presence of PPh3 moiety, which could have an important role in detoxification mechanism and others. Finally, ion mobility mass spectrometry (IMMS) experiments have proved that there is no significant change in the gas phase structural conformation of the proteins owing to their bonding to ruthenium complexes.

AB Maternal nutrition can have a profound effect on fetal growth, development, and subsequent infant birth weight. Preconception dietary patterns have not been assessed in relation to perinatal outcomes. The objectives of this study were to identify associations between maternal dietary patterns in the 12 mo before conception on fetal growth and preterm delivery. Preconception food frequency data were collected retrospectively in 309 women. Dietary patterns were derived using factor analysis. Perinatal outcomes were collected at delivery with birth weight data calculated into percentiles to assess small and large for gestational age and preterm delivery at <37 wk. Three dietary patterns were identified: 1), high-protein/fruit (characterized by fish, meat, chicken, fruit, and some whole grains); 2) high-fat/sugar/takeaway (takeaway foods, potato chips, refined grains); and 3) vegetarian-type (vegetables, legumes, whole grains). A 1-SD increase in the scores on the high-protein/fruit pattern was associated with decreased likelihood of preterm birth (adjusted OR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.72; P = 0.007), whereas the reverse direction was apparent for the high-fat/sugar/takeaway pattern (adjusted OR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.15; P = 0.011). A 1-SD increase in the scores on the high fat/sugar/takeaway pattern was also associated with shorter gestation (adjusted regression coefficient: -2.7; 95% CI: -4.3, -1.1; P = 0.001) and birth length (adjusted regression coefficient: -0.5; 95% CI: -0.8, -0.1; P = 0.004). Nutrition before pregnancy is associated with perinatal outcomes. A dietary pattern containing several protein-rich food sources, fruit, and some whole grains is associated with reduced likelihood for preterm delivery, whereas a dietary pattern mainly consisting of discretionary items is associated with preterm delivery, shorter birth length, and earlier gestation. Poor dietary behaviors in the periconceptional period could be altered to promote behavior change in dietary intake to improve perinatal outcomes and the long-term health of the child.

AB Diploid strawberry and potato transformed with a transposon tagging construct exhibited either global (strawberry) or local transposition (potato). An activation tagged, compact-sized strawberry mutant overexpressed the gene adjacent to Ds.
   As major fruit and vegetable crops, respectively, strawberry and potato are among the first horticultural crops with draft genome sequences. To study gene function, we examined transposon-tagged mutant strategies in model populations for both species, Fragaria vesca and Solanum tuberosum Group Phureja, using the same Activation/Dissociation (Ac/Ds) construct. Early somatic transposition during tissue culture occurred at a frequency of 18.5 % in strawberry but not in potato transformants. Green fluorescent protein under a monocot promoter was a more reliable selectable marker in strawberry compared to potato. BASTA (gluphosinate herbicide) resistance served as an effective selectable marker for both species (80 and 85 % reliable in strawberry and potato, respectively), although the effective concentration differed (0.5 % for strawberry and 0.03 % for potato). Transposons preferentially reinserted within genes (exons and introns) in both species. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed enhanced gene expression (670 and 298-fold expression compared to wild type in petiole and leaf tissue, respectively) for an activation tagged strawberry mutant with Ds inserted about 0.6 kb upstream from a gene coding for an epidermis-specific secreted glycoprotein EP1. Our data also suggested that endopolyploid (diploid) cells occurring in leaf explants of monoploid potato were the favored targets of T-DNA integration during transformation. Mutants obtained in these studies provide a useful resource for future genetic studies.

   AGRICULTURE; PRINCIPLES
AB Existing crop monitoring programs determine the incidence and distribution of plant diseases and pathogens and assess the damage caused within a crop production region. These programs have traditionally used observed or predicted disease and pathogen data and environmental information to prescribe management practices that minimize crop loss (3,69). Monitoring programs are especially important for crops with broad geographic distribution or for diseases that can cause rapid and great economic losses. Successful monitoring programs have been developed for several plant diseases, including downy mildew of cucurbits, Fusarium head blight of wheat, potato late blight, and rusts of cereal crops (13,36,51,80).
   A recent example of a successful disease-monitoring program for an economically important crop is the soybean rust (SBR) monitoring effort within North America. SBR, caused by the fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi Sydow, was first identified in the continental United States in November 2004 (59; Sidebar 1: Soybean rust disease cycle). SBR causes moderate to severe yield losses globally (6,25,42,54). The fungus produces foliar lesions on soybean (Glycine max Merrill) and other legume hosts. P. pachyrhizi diverts nutrients from the host to its own growth and reproduction. The lesions also reduce photosynthetic area. Uredinia rupture the host epidermis and diminish stomatal regulation of transpiration to cause tissue desiccation and premature defoliation (Fig. 1) (6). Severe soybean yield losses can occur if plants defoliate during the mid-reproductive growth stages (25,38).
   Since 2004, soybean has been produced on approximately 30 million hectares annually in the United States, with a value between $18 billion and $32 billion (74). Therefore, the threat of this destructive disease warranted the attention of farmers, agricultural industries, university scientists, and national and state/provincial governmental agencies. The rapid response to the threat of SBR in North America resulted in an unprecedented amount of information dissemination and the development of a real-time, publicly available monitoring and prediction system known as the Soybean Rust-Pest Information Platform for Extension and Education (SBR-PIPE). Several comprehensive reviews of SBR and the SBR-PIPE were published (6,21,23,29,33,79). The objectives of this article are (i) to highlight the successful response effort to SBR in North America, and (ii) to introduce researchers to the quantity and type of data generated by SBR-PIPE. Data from this system may now be used to answer questions about the biology, ecology, and epidemiology of an important pathogen and disease of soybean.

TI Increased Difficulties to Control Late Blight in Tunisia Are Caused by a
   Genetically Diverse Phytophthora infestans Population Next to the Clonal
   Lineage NA-01
SO PLANT DISEASE

   NETHERLANDS; VIRULENCE
AB In Tunisia, late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans is a serious threat to potato and tomato. The Mediterranean weather conditions can be conducive to infection in all seasons and the host crops, tomato and potato, are grown year round. Potato is planted and harvested in two to four overlapping intervals from August to June and tomato is grown both in open fields and in greenhouses. The consequences of these agricultural practices and the massive import of seed potato on the genetic variation of P. infestans are largely unknown. We conducted a survey in which 165 P. infestans isolates, collected from five subregions in Tunisia between 2006 and 2008, on which we studied genotypic diversity through nuclear (simple-sequence repeat [SSR.]) markers and combined this with a previous study on their mitochondrial haplotypes (mtDNA). The phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of a major clonal lineage (NA-01, Al mating type, mitochondrial haplotype Ia). Isolates belonging to this clonal lineage were found in all regions and showed a relatively simple virulence pattern on a potato differential set carrying different Solanum demissum resistance genes. Apart from isolates belonging to this NA-01 clonal lineage, a group of isolates was found that showed a high genetic diversity, comprising both mating types and a more complex race structure that was found in the regions where late blight on potato was more difficult to control. The population on potato and tomato seems to be under different selection pressures. Isolates collected from tomato showed a low genetic diversity even though potato isolates collected simultaneously from the same location showed a high genetic diversity. Based on the SSR profile comparison, we could demonstrate that the four major clonal lineages found in the Netherlands and also in other European countries could not be found in Tunisia. Despite the massive import of potato seed from Europe, the P. infestans population in Tunisia was found to be clearly distinct.

AB Triploid watermelon cultivars are grown on more than 2,023 ha in Maryland and in Delaware. Triploid watermelon cultivars have little host resistance to Fusarium wilt of watermelon (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum). The effects of four different fall-planted cover crops (Vicia villosa, Trifolium incarnatum, Secale cereale, and Brassica juncea) that were tilled in the spring as green manures, and bare ground, were evaluated alone and in combination with the biocontrol product Actinovate (Streptomyces lydicus) on Fusarium wilt severity and watermelon fruit yield and quality. Six field experiments were conducted over 3 years in Beltsville and Salisbury, MD and Georgetown, DE. Both V. villosa and T. incarnatum significantly suppressed Fusarium wilt of watermelon as much as 21% compared with watermelon in nonamended plots. However, no suppression of Fusarium wilt occurred at low disease levels or where low cover crop biomass was present. In general, Beltsville, MD had lower disease levels than Salisbury, MD and Georgetown, DE. T. incarnatum was the only cover crop that yielded significantly more fruit than nonamended treatments (129% more fruit per hectare) but only for one field trial. The Actinovate product either did not reduce Fusarium wilt or the magnitude of the reduction was nominal. Actinovate significantly reduced Fusarium wilt by 2% in 2009 and as much as 7% in 2010, and increased Fusarium wilt severity by 2.5% in 2011. Actinovate significantly increased yield for one field trial but only when applied to nonamended or Secale cereal-amended plots. This is the first report of a reduction in Fusarium wilt following a T. incarnatum cover crop incorporated as a green manure.

AB Plant growth can reportedly be promoted by poly(gamma-glutamic acid) (gamma-PGA). However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. To reveal the mechanism of gamma-PGA, we designed an experiment that investigated the effect of gamma-PGA on the nitrogen metabolism of Chinese cabbage hydroponic cultured at different calcium (Ca) levels and varied exogenous Ca2+ inhibitors. The results showed that nitrate reductase (NR), glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate synthase, and glutamate dehydrogenase activities in leaves and roots were obviously enhanced by gamma-PGA at the normal Ca2+ level (4.0 mM). Meanwhile, gamma-PGA increased the content of total nitrogen, soluble protein, and soluble amino acids in leaves. However, the promotional effect of gamma-PGA on fresh weight weakened when Ca2+ was inadequate. Moreover, gamma-PGA not only induced the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and Ca2+ in organelles into cytoplasm, but also increased the Ca2+-ATPase level to modify Ca2+ homeostasis in plant cells. In addition, exogenous Ca2+ inhibitors significantly suppressed the gamma-PGA-mediated promotion of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ level, calmodulin (CaM) content, GS and glutamate dehydrogenase activities. In summary, gamma-PGA accelerated the nitrogen metabolism of plants through the Ca2+/CaM signaling pathway, thereby improving the growth of the plant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB SnRK1 activity is developmentally regulated in bean seeds and exhibits a transient increase with the highest value at 20 days after anthesis (DAA), which coincides with the beginning of protein and starch accumulation. The catalytic subunit of SnRK1 shows a consistent decrease throughout the seed development period. However, by 15 DAA a significant proportion of the catalytic subunit appears phosphorylated. The increase in activity and phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit coincides with a decrease in hexoses. However, SnRK1 activity is differentially regulated in the cotyledon and embryo axe, where a larger proportion of the catalytic subunit is phosphorylated. SnRK1 obtained from endosperm extract is inhibited by T6P and to a lesser extent by ADPG and UDPG, whereas the enzyme isolated from embryo is virtually insensitive to T6P but exhibits some inhibition by ADPG and UDPG. In cotyledon extracts, the effects of T6P and ADPG on SnRK1 activity are additive, whereas in embryo extract, T6P inhibits the enzyme only when ADPG is present. After fractionation on Sephacryl-S300, SnRK1 activity obtained from cotyledon extracts is detected as a single peak associated with a molecular weight of 250 kDa whereas that obtained form embryo axe extracts detected as 2 peaks associated with molecular weight of 250 and 180 kDa. In both cases, the catalytic subunit exhibits a wide distribution but is concentrated in the fractions with the highest activity. To analyse the composition of the complex, cotyledon and embryo extracts were treated with a reversible crosslinker (DSP). DSP induced the formation of complexes with molecular weights of 97 and 180 kDa in the cotyledon and embryo extracts, respectively. Since all the phosphorylated catalytic subunit is present in the complexes induced by DSP, it appears that the phosphorylation favors its interaction with other proteins.

AB While C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors (TF) are often regulated by abiotic stress, their role during insect infestation has been overlooked. This study demonstrates that the transcripts of the zinc finger transcription factors StZFP1 and StZFP2 are induced in potato (Solanum tuberosum L) upon infestation by either the generalist tobacco hornworm (THW, Manduca sexta L.) or the specialist Colorado potato beetle (CPB, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say). StZFP1 has been previously characterized as conferring salt tolerance to transgenic tobacco and its transcript is induced by Phytophthora infestans and several abiotic stresses. StZFP2 has not been characterized previously, but contains the hallmarks of a C2H2 zinc finger TF, with two conserved zinc finger domains and DLN motif, which encodes a transcriptional repressor domain. Expression studies demonstrate that StZFP2 transcript is also induced by tobacco hornworm and Colorado potato beetle. These observations expand the role of the C2H2 transcription factor in potato to include the response to chewing insect pests. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB The quality and safety of herbal medicines is becoming a major concern worldwide particularly due to contamination by heavy metals. The present study quantified the levels of heavy metals in frequently used South African medicinal plants and determined the variations in certain biological activities and phytochemical compositions. Eleven plant species were obtained from both muthi shops (MS) (commercial outlets) and from open street markets (OSM) for comparison. Samples were dried, powdered and digested using microwave acid-assisted digestion. The digested solutions were analysed for heavy metals using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Plants were classified based on their elemental composition using chemometric techniques. Powdered plant samples were extracted using 70% acetone and screened for antibacterial activity against E. colt and S. aureus. Phytochemical analyses were carried out to determine total phenolic and flavonoid content. Of the 22 samples analysed, Bulbine natalensis obtained from OSM and Alepidea amatymbica obtained from MS exhibited high levels of Al [5559 and 4392 mg/kg dry weight (DW)] and Fe (4164 and 4465 mg/kg DW) respectively. Levels of As and Hg were above the World Health Organization permissible limits in most of the samples analysed. Hierarchical cluster analysis classified the samples into four groups based on their metallic analyte concentrations. Group one having low metal content and group four having a high metal content. In general, plant samples with high levels of metals yielded greater antibacterial activity. However, antibacterial activity recorded in this study is not an indicator of high levels of heavy metal contamination as some samples despite the high levels of metal exhibited low antibacterial activity. The variations in the amounts of phenolics and flavonoids in the evaluated samples could have probably been that some of the plant samples may have been harvested from different localities or at different times of the year, perhaps plant age or degree of storage. The results highlighted the need for in-depth risk and quality assessments. (C) 2014 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, chemical liver injury cases increased significantly in Asian countries, and the imbalance in redox system was believed to be the main cause. Purple sweet potato anthocyanins (PSPA) have been shown to exert antioxidant activity and oxidative-stress-associated functional protein modulation through various signaling pathways, so it is considered to have the potential of liver injury preventive activity. In order to evaluate the hepatoprotective potency of PSPA according to its free radical scavenging and antioxidant effects, three acute chemical liver injury models were set up with ethanol, acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride. PSPA at moderate and high doses obviously attenuated the tested serum biomarker levels and liver index in our experiments. Besides, one chronic liver injury model set up with carbon tetrachloride was also applied, in which PSPA was orally administrated after the liver damage had been formed. Both the serum biomarker levels and histopathological analysis showed that PSPA was able to attenuated chronic liver injury. Our experimental results demonstrated the potential of PSPA as an oral hepatoprotective agent against chemical liver injury from food plant.

AB BACKGROUND: Acrylamide has attracted worldwide concerns because of its demonstrated neurotoxicity, genetoxicity and reproductive-development toxicity. It is necessary to control acrylamide production during food processing and protect human health.
   RESULTS: In this study, a functionalised material was synthesised by immobilising an ionic liquid onto an activated silica gel surface. The adsorption ability of the material towards acrylamide was evaluated, and the results showed that it had high adsorption capacity. Scatchard analysis indicated that the binding sites in the prepared material had two distinct groups (high and low affinity binding sites). The saturated adsorption capacity (Q(max, 1)) was 7.9 mg g(-1) due to the high affinity binding sites, and another saturated adsorption capacity (Q(max, 2)) was 2.3 mg g(-1) due to the low affinity binding sites. This prepared material also offered fast kinetics for adsorption of the acrylamide. Using this material as sorbent, a method of solid-phase extraction coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (SPE-HPLC) for analysis of acrylamide in foods was developed. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection (S/N = 3) of this method for acrylamide was 2.1 mu g kg(-1), and the RSD for five replicate extractions of 50 mu L-1 acrylamide was 4.5%. The blank potato and bread crumb samples spiked with acrylamide at different levels of 10.0 and 15.0 mu g kg(-1) were extracted and determined respectively by this developed method, and recoveries ranging from 83.0% to 89.1% were obtained. Finally, this method was applied to quantitative detection of acrylamide in bread crust and cracker samples.
   CONCLUSION: With high sensitivity and pre-treatment simplicity, this SPE-HPLC method could provide a new tool for the rapid determination of acrylamide in the food samples. (C) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry

AB This paper examines the function of Arabidopsis thaliana AtPTB1 and AtPTB2 as plant splicing factors. The effect on splicing of overexpression of AtPTB1 and AtPTB2 was analysed in an in vivo protoplast transient expression system with a novel mini-exon splicing reporter. A range of mutations in pyrimidine-rich sequences were compared with and without AtPTB and NpU2AF65 overexpression. Splicing analyses of constructs in protoplasts and RNA from overexpression lines used high-resolution reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). AtPTB1 and AtPTB2 reduced inclusion/splicing of the potato invertase mini-exon splicing reporter, indicating that these proteins can repress plant intron splicing. Mutation of the polypyrimidine tract and closely associated Cytosine and Uracil-rich (CU-rich) sequences, upstream of the mini-exon, altered repression by AtPTB1 and AtPTB2. Coexpression of a plant orthologue of U2AF65 alleviated the splicing repression of AtPTB1. Mutation of a second CU-rich upstream of the mini-exon 3 splice site led to a decline in mini-exon splicing, indicating the presence of a splicing enhancer sequence. Finally, RT-PCR of AtPTB overexpression lines with c. 90 known alternative splicing (AS) events showed that AtPTBs significantly altered AS of over half the events. AtPTB1 and AtPTB2 are splicing factors that influence alternative splicing. This occurs in the potato invertase mini-exon via the polypyrimidine tract and associated pyrimidine-rich sequence.

AB Glucan, water dikinase (GWD) is a key enzyme of starch metabolism but the physico-chemical properties of starches isolated from GWD-deficient plants and their implications for starch metabolism have so far not been described. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants with reduced or no GWD activity were used to investigate the properties of starch granules. In addition, using various in vitro assays, the action of recombinant GWD, -amylase, isoamylase and starch synthase 1 on the surface of native starch granules was analysed. The internal structure of granules isolated from GWD mutant plants is unaffected, as thermal stability, allomorph, chain length distribution and density of starch granules were similar to wild-type. However, short glucan chain residues located at the granule surface dominate in starches of transgenic plants and impede GWD activity. A similarly reduced rate of phosphorylation by GWD was also observed in potato tuber starch fractions that differ in the proportion of accessible glucan chain residues at the granule surface. A model is proposed to explain the characteristic morphology of starch granules observed in GWD transgenic plants. The model postulates that the occupancy rate of single glucan chains at the granule surface limits accessibility to starch-related enzymes.

AB Plant endoparasitic nematodes induce the formation of their feeding cells by injecting effectors from the esophageal glands into root cells. Although vascular cylinder cells seem to be involved in the formation of root-knot nematode (RKN) feeding structures, molecular evidence is scarce. We address the role during gall development of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN 16 (LBD16), a key component of the auxin pathway leading to the divisions in the xylem pole pericycle (XPP) for lateral root (LR) formation. Arabidopsis T-DNA tagged J0192 and J0121 XPP marker lines, LBD16 and DR5::GUS promoter lines, and isolated J0192 protoplasts were assayed for nematode-dependent gene expression. Infection tests in LBD16 knock-out lines were used for functional analysis. J0192 and J0121 lines were activated in early developing galls and giant cells (GCs), resembling the pattern of the G2/M-transition specific ProCycB1;1:CycB1;1(NT)-GUS line. LBD16 was regulated by auxins in galls as in LRs, and induced by RKN secretions. LBD16 loss of function mutants and a transgenic line with defective XPP cells showed a significantly reduced infection rate. The results show that genes expressed in the dividing XPP, particularly LBD16, are important for gall formation, as they are for LR development.

AB Two pathogenic races of Verticillium dahliae have been described on lettuce and tomato. Host resistance to race 1 is governed by plant immune receptors that recognize the race 1-specific fungal effector Ave1. Only partial resistance to race 2 exists in lettuce. Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are available to identify race 1, no complementary test exists to positively identify race 2, except for lengthy pathogenicity assays on host differentials. Using the genome sequences of two isolates of V dahliae, one each from races 1 and 2, we identified potential markers and PCR primers to distinguish the two races. Several primer pairs based on polymorphisms between the races were designed and tested on reference isolates of known race. One primer pair, VdR2F-VdR2R, consistently yielded a 256-bp amplicon in all race 2 isolates exclusively. We screened DNA from 677 V dahliae isolates, including 340 from spinach seedlots, with the above primer pair and a previously published race 1-specific primer pain DNA from isolates that did not amplify with race 1-specific PCRs amplified with the race 2-specific primers. To validate this, two differential lines of lettuce were inoculated with 53 arbitrarily selected isolates from spinach seed and their pathogenicity and virulence were assessed in a greenhouse. The reactions of the differential cultivars strongly supported the PCR data V dahliae race structure was investigated in crops in coastal California and elsewhere using primers specific to the two races. All artichoke isolates from California were race 1, whereas nearly all tomato isolates were race 2. Isolates from lettuce, pepper, and strawberry from California as well as isolates from spinach seed from two of four countries comprised both races, whereas only race 2 was observed in cotton, mint, olive, and potato. This highlights the importance of identifying resistance against race 2 in different hosts. The technique developed in this study will benefit studies in ecology, population biology, disease surveillance, and epidemiology at local and global scales, and resistance breeding against race 2 in lettuce and other crops.

AB Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) exists as a complex of strains classified by reactions to resistance genes found in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris); seven BCMV pathotypes have been distinguished thus far, numbered I to VII. Virus genetic determinants involved in pathogenicity interactions with resistance genes have not yet been identified. Here, we describe the characterization of two novel field isolates of BCMV that helped to narrow down these genetic determinants interacting with specific R vulgaris resistance factors. Based on a biological characterization on common bean differentials, both isolates were classified as belonging to pathotype VII, similar to control isolate US 10, and both isolates exhibited the B serotype. The whole genome was sequenced for both isolates and found to be 98 to 99% identical to the BCMV isolate RU1 (pathotype VI), and a single name was retained: BCMV RU1-OR. To identify a genetic determinant of BCMV linked to the BCMV pathotype VII, the whole genome was also sequenced for two control isolates, US10 and RU1-P. Inspection of the nucleotide sequences for BCMV RU1-OR and US10 (both pathotype VII) and three closely related sequences of BCMV (RU1-P, RU1-D, and RU1-W, all pathotype VI) revealed that RU1-OR originated through a series of recombination events between US10 and an as-yet-unidentified BCMV parental genome, resulting in changes in virus pathology. The data obtained suggest that a fragment of the RU1-OR genome between positions 723 and 1,961 nucleotides that is common to US10 and RU1-OR in the P1-HC-Pro region of the BCMV genome may be responsible for the ability to overcome resistance in bean conferred by the bc-2(2) gene. This is the first report of a virus genetic determinant responsible for overcoming a specific BCMV resistance gene in common bean.

AB Nicotiana attenuata plants silenced in the expression of GLYCEROLIPASEA1 (ir-gla1 plants) are compromised in the herbivore- and wound-induced accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA). However, these plants accumulate wild-type (WT) levels of JA and divinyl-ethers during Phytophthora parasitica infection. By profiling oxylipin-enriched fractions with targeted and untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry approaches, we demonstrate that the accumulation of 9-hydroxy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (9-OH-18:2) and additional C-18 and C-19 oxylipins is reduced by ca. 20-fold in P.parasitica-infected ir-gla1 leaves compared with WT. This reduced accumulation of oxylipins was accompanied by a reduced accumulation of unsaturated free fatty acids and specific lysolipid species. Untargeted metabolic profiling of total leaf extracts showed that 87 metabolites accumulated differentially in leaves of P.parasitica-infected ir-gla1 plants with glycerolipids, hydroxylated-diterpene glycosides and phenylpropanoid derivatives accounting together for ca. 20% of these 87 metabolites. Thus, P.parasitica-induced oxylipins may participate in the regulation of metabolic changes during infection. Together, the results demonstrate that GLA1 plays a distinct role in the production of oxylipins during biotic stress responses, supplying substrates for 9-OH-18:2 and additional C-18 and C-19 oxylipin formation during P.parasitica infection, whereas supplying substrates for the biogenesis of JA during herbivory and mechanical wounding.

AB This article examines the explosion of advice literature for Russian girls since 1991, including literally hundreds of books have appeared on the market with such titles as Encyclopedia for Girls and Girls, A Book for You. Such titles are often given as gifts by parents and family members to help girls navigate the various social situations, household duties, dating rituals, consumer choices, and dangers facing girls in post-Soviet Russia. Written in the long-standing tradition of etiquette literature dating back to the eighteenth century, these fascinating documents of social mores reflect how the rise of consumer culture and collapse of the Soviet state have shaped a culture of hyperfeminity and gender difference in reaction to Soviet-era policies promoting gender equality.

AB Field trials were carried out to evaluate six treatments combining biological agents and chemical fungicides applied via chemigation against white mold (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) on processing tomatoes. The experiment was performed in Goiania, Brazil, with tomato hybrid Heinz 7155 in 2009 and 2010 in a field previously infested with S. sclerotiorum sclerotia. Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design in a 2 x 3 factorial structure (with and without Trichoderma spp. 1.0 x 10(9) viable conidia ha(-1)) x fluazinam (1.0 L ha(-1)), procimidone (1.5 L ha(-1)) and control, applied by, drip irrigation. Treatments were applied three times 10 days apart, starting one month after transplanting. Each treatment consisted of plots with three 72-meter rows with four plants m(-1) and 1.5 m spacing between rows, with three replications. Based on disease incidence evaluated weekly, the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was obtained. Yield and its components were evaluated in addition to fruit pH and degrees Brix. Results were subjected to ANOVA, Scott-Knott (5%), and regression analysis. Biocontrol using Trichoderma spp. via chemigation singly or in combination with synthetic fungicides fluazinam and procimidone reduced AUDPC and increased fruit yield up to 25 t ha(-1). The best treatment for controlling white mold also increased pulp yield around 1.0 and 7.0 t ha(-1) in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The present work demonstrated the advantages of white mold biological control in processing tomato crops, where drip irrigation favored Trichoderma spp. delivery close to the plants and to the inoculum source.

AB Selection for genetic adaptation might occur whenever an animal colony is maintained in the laboratory. The laboratory adaptation of behavior such as foraging, dispersal ability, and mating competitiveness often causes difficulties in the maintenance of biological control agents and other beneficial organisms used in procedures such as the sterile insect technique (SIT). Sweet potato weevil, Cylas formicarius (Summers) (Coleoptera: Brentidae), is an important pest in sub-tropical and tropical regions. An eradication program targeting C.formicarius using SIT was initiated in Japan with weevils being mass-reared for 95 generations to obtain sufficient sterile males. The mass-reared strain of C.formicarius exhibits weaker female resistance to male mating attempts compared with the wild strain. This could affect the success of SIT programs because mating persistence of mass-reared males might be expected to decrease in response to weak female resistance. We show that high success of sperm transfer to mass-reared females was due to weak female resistance to male mating attempts. However, the mating behavior of mass-reared males did not change. In C.formicarius, the trait of male persistence to mate was not correlated with the female resistance traits. Our results suggest that mass-rearing conditions do not have negative effects on the mating ability of the sterile males of this species, and thus that the current mass-rearing procedures are suitable for production of sterile males for the weevil eradication program.

AB Both plants and animals rely on nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing (NB-LRR or NLR) proteins to respond to invading pathogens and activate immune responses. How plant NB-LRR proteins respond to pathogens is poorly understood. We undertook a gain-of-function random mutagenesis screen of the potato NB-LRR immune receptor R3a to study how this protein responds to the effector protein AVR3a from the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans. R3a response can be extended to the stealthy AVR3a(EM) isoform of the effector while retaining recognition of AVR3a(KI). Each one of eight single amino acid mutations is sufficient to expand the R3a response to AVR3a(EM) and other AVR3a variants. These mutations occur across the R3a protein, from the N terminus to different regions of the LRR domain. Further characterization of these R3a mutants revealed that at least one of them was sensitized, exhibiting a stronger response than the wild-type R3a protein to AVR3a(KI). Remarkably, the N336Y mutation, near the R3a nucleotide-binding pocket, conferred response to the effector protein PcAVR3a4 from the vegetable pathogen P. capsici. This work contributes to understanding how NB-LRR receptor specificity can be modulated. Together with knowledge of pathogen effector diversity, this strategy can be exploited to develop synthetic immune receptors.

AB Bacteria from the genus Dickeya (formerly Erwinia chrysanthemi) are plant pathogens causing severe diseases in many economically important crops. A majority of the strains responsible for potato disease in Europe belong to a newly identified Dickeya solani species. Although some ecological and epidemiological studies have been carried out, little is known about the regulation of D. solani virulence. The characterization of four D. solani strains indicates significant differences in their virulence on potato, although they are genetically similar based on genomic fingerprinting profiles. A phenotypic examination included an analysis of virulence on potato; growth rate in culture; motility; Fe3+ chelation; and pectate lyase, cellulase, protease, biosurfactant, and blue pigment production. Mutants of four D. solani strains were constructed by inactivating the genes coding either for one of the main negative regulators of D. dadantii virulence (kdgR, pecS, and pecT) or for the synthesis and perception of signaling molecules (expI and expR). Analysis of these mutants indicated that PecS, PecT, and KdgR play a similar role in both species, repressing, to different degrees, the synthesis of virulence factors. The thermoregulator PecT seems to be a major regulator of D. solani virulence. This work also reveals the role of quorum sensing mediated by ExpI and ExpR in D. solani virulence on potato.

AB This study provides insights into the pathogenesis of Ralstonia solanacearum, in particular with regards to strains belonging to phylotype IIB, sequevar 1 (IIB-1) and their interaction with potato, its natural host. We performed a comparative genomic analysis among IIB-1 R. solanacearum strains with different levels of virulence in order to identify candidate virulence genes. With this approach, we identified a 33.7-kb deletion in a strain showing reduced virulence on potato. This region contains a cluster of six genes putatively involved in type IV pili (Tfp) biogenesis. Functional analysis suggests that these proteins contribute to several Tfp-related functions such as twitching motility and biofilm formation. In addition, this genetic cluster was found to contribute to early bacterial wilt pathogenesis and colonization fitness of potato roots.

AB This study aimed to evaluate under photoautotrophic conditions the effect of CO2-enriched atmosphere (360 or 1,000 mu mol CO2 mol(-1) air) combined with two substrate types (agar or Florialite(A (R))) in vitro on plants of Pfaffia glomerata, an endangered medicinal species with promising applications in phytotherapy and phytomedicine. The effects of the treatments on the growth, stomatal density, Rubisco activity, carbon isotopic discrimination, metabolite accumulation, photosynthetic pigments and ultrastructural characteristics were investigated. After a 35-day cultivation period, the in vitro-growth of P. glomerata nodal segments under the different treatments resulted in plants with substantial differences in relation to their growth, photosynthetic pigments, stomatal density and leaf ultrastructural characteristics. The enrichment with CO2 coupled with a porous substrate increased the growth of P. glomerata. The stomatal density in the abaxial epidermis more than doubled in response to the high CO2 supply in both supporting types, whereas the Rubisco activity and activation state were both unresponsive to the treatments. Regardless of the CO2 supply, the plants grown in agar displayed higher carbon isotope discrimination than their counterparts grown in Florialite(A (R)). We propose that the long-term photosynthetic performance was improved using Florialite(A (R)) as a growth support in combination with a high CO2 supply. No apparent signs of photosynthetic down-regulation could be found under elevated CO2 conditions. The enrichment of in vitro atmospheres with CO2 coupled with a porous substrate offers new possibilities for improving the growth and production on a commercial scale of high morphological and physiological quality Pfaffia plants.

AB The selectable marker cyanamide hydratase/cyanamide was successfully used to generate transgenic potato plants from the cultivars Russet Burbank, Ranger Russet, Bintje, Desiree, Kardal and Pentland Dell. Up to 3,000 transgenics per person per year were produced. The efficiency of transgenic production varied among cultivars, and was in general 2-3 times lower than the transformation efficiency (TE) using the selectable marker kanamycin. Differences between cultivars in sensitivity to cyanamide selection were observed, but in general a concentration of 30 mg/l was applied for selection of transgenic shoots. A stepwise increase of cyanamide concentration during the transformation procedure for Russet Burbank resulted in an improved TE via a reduction of the escape efficiency from 69 to 29 %. The cultivars differed in the hormone concentration and duration (2,4-D and Zeatin riboside) required for the production of transgenics, predominantly during the phase of shoot initiation. Only for cultivars Bintje and Pentland Dell, adaptations in the hormone scheme are required during the transformation procedure with cyanamide selection compared to selection on kanamycin. Upon application of a transformation protocol for Russet Burbank, only in 1 % of the plants (in a population of 241) Agrobacterium could be detected, but these bacteria did not contain the vector for transgene transfer anymore.

AB The gradual increase of soil cadmium concentrations in European soils during the 20th century has prompted environmental legislation to limit soil cadmium (Cd) accumulation. Mass balances (input-output) reflecting the period 1980-1995 predicted larger Cd inputs via phosphate (P) fertilizers and atmospheric deposition than outputs via crop uptake and leaching. This study updates the Cd mass balance for the agricultural top soils of EU-27 + Norway (EU-27 + 1). Over the past 15 years, the use of P fertilizers in the EU-27 + 1 has decreased by 40%. The current mean atmospheric deposition of Cd in EU is 0.35 g Cd ha(-1) yr(-1), this is strikingly smaller than values used in the previous EU mass balances (similar to 3 g Cd ha(-1) yr(-1)). Leaching of Cd was estimated with most recent data of soil solution Cd concentrations in 151 soils, which cover the range of European soil properties. No significant time trends were found in the data of net applications of Cd via manure, compost, sludge and lime, all being small sources of Cd at a large scale. Modelling of the future long-term changes in soil Cd concentrations in agricultural top soils under cereal or potato culture predicts soil Cd concentrations to decrease by 15% over the next 100 years in an average scenario, with decreasing trends in some scenarios being more prevalent than increasing trends in other scenarios. These Cd balances have reverted from the general positive balances estimated 10 or more years ago. Uncertainty analysis suggests that leaching is the most uncertain relative to other fluxes.

Our result applies, in particular, to the heat operator on stratified Lie groups and to Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck-type operators. We show that the open sets characterizing the solutions to the involved equations, in terms of suitable average operators, have to be the level sets of the fundamental solutions of the relevant operators. The technique adopted exploits the structure of the propagation sets, i.e., the sets where the solutions to the involved equations attain their maximum.

AB Slow-release fertilizers could improve the productivity of field crops and reduce environmental pollution. So far, no slow-release fertilizers are suited for maize cultivation in semiarid areas of China. Therefore, we tested attapulgite-coated fertilizers. Attapulgite-coated fertilizers were prepared by dividing chemical fertilizers into three parts according to the nutrient demand of maize in its three main growth stages and coating each part with a layer of attapulgite. This design is novel and unique, satisfying the demands of maize throughout the whole growing season with slow release of nutrients from the coated layers. A field experiment was conducted in 2010 and 2011, using three fertilizer rates, in kg/ha: 94.22 nitrogen (N) and 22.49 phosphorus (P), 139.09 N and 38.98 P, and 254.23 N and 50.98 P. Five types of fertilizers were compared: 20 and 30 % attapulgite-coated chemical fertilizer, 20 and 30 % attapulgite-mixed chemical fertilizer, and chemical fertilizer only. The results show that the soil mineral N and available P of attapulgite-coated fertilizer has a slow-release behavior that allows a better synchronization between nutrient availability and plant needs. Attapulgite-coated fertilizer increased the grain yield by 15.1-18.4 %. The use of attapulgite-coated fertilizers also improved partial factor productivity of N fertilizer by 10.0-26.7 % and P fertilizer by 11.0-26.7 %, compared with the control fertilized without coated formulates. Given their good performance, the attapulgite-coated fertilizers could be a promising alternative slow-release fertilizer for sustainable agriculture in semiarid areas.

AB Phosphite is a general term used to describe the salts of phosphorous acid H3PO3. It is effective in suppressing a number of plant diseases caused by oomycetes and has been shown to reduce populations of several insect species. We investigated the effects of phosphite on the Colorado potato beetles in the field and laboratory. Beetle numbers and defoliation on phosphite-treated plots were lower compared to the control plots during one out of two years of the study. No phosphite effects were detected in the field during the second year of the study. However, larval mortality was significantly higher the second year in the laboratory when larvae were fed on potato foliage excised from the potato plants treated with phosphite in the field. Laboratory tests with excised leaves dipped in a solution of phosphite revealed lower beetle survivorship and prolonged development on the treated foliage. Because of its dual properties as a fungicide and an insecticide, as well as its low toxicity to vertebrates, phosphite is a potentially good fit for integrated pest management programs.

AB Development of alternative serological techniques to ELISA for detection of potato viruses offers advantages for monitoring virus incidence and for seed potato certification systems. Several trials showed that multiplex tissue print immunoassay (TPIA) and dot blot immunoassay (DBIA) might represent fast, practical, and sensitive alternatives for the detection of: Potato leaf roll virus (PLRV), Potato virus S (PVS), Potato virus X (PVX) and Potato virus Y (PVY), from green and/or tuber tissues. In TPIA, the specific precipitation patterns in infected tissues of leaf petioles or stem cross sections, observed with each virus, allowed identification of the specific virus or mixed infections in a single multiplex assay. For detection of PVY in green tissues, DBIA was shown to be over 50 times more sensitive than ELISA. TPIA and ELISA from the tuber stem end or from eyes might be used for rapid detection of PVY and PVS in seed potato tubers without prior germination. PVS was evenly distributed in potato tuber tissue, while PVY was localized in the vascular tissue beneath the epidermis, with irregular distribution along the periphery of the potato tuber. For laboratories in developing countries lacking time and facilities for tests based on tuber germination, monitoring for PVS and PVY using TPIA in tuber tissue may be a suitable alternative to ELISA.

AB Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants were generated by introduction of the human P450 CYP1A2 gene, which metabolizes a number of herbicides, insecticides and industrial chemicals. Transgenic A. thaliana plants expressing CYP1A2 gene showed remarkable resistance to the phenylurea herbicide chlortoluron (CTU) supplemented either in plant growth medium or sprayed on foliar parts of the plants. HPLC analyses showed a strong reduction in CTU accumulation in planta supporting the tolerance of transgenic lines to high concentrations of CTU. Besides increased herbicide tolerance, expression of CYP1A2 resulted in no other visible phenotype in transgenic plants. Our data indicate that CYP1A2 can be used as a selectable marker for plant transformation, allowing efficient selection of transgenic lines in growth medium and/or in soil-grown plants. Moreover, these transgenic plants appear to be useful for herbicide resistance as well as phytoremediation of environmental contaminants.

AB Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. odoriferum has been generally considered to have a narrow host range and has been isolated most often from chicory. Research was conducted to identify 91 Pectobacterium spp. strains isolated from different vegetables in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa, and to compare their ability to cause disease in chicory and potato. Among the 91 strains, 22 strains from Europe were identified as P. c. subsp. odoriferum. Based on phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA, recA, and rpoS gene sequences, strains isolated from stored vegetables clustered together with the type strain of P. c. subsp. odoriferum and clustered separately from the P. c. subsp. carotovorum isolates. Eleven strains previously identified as P. c. subsp. carotovorum were reclassified as P. c. subsp. odoriferum. All P. c. subsp. odoriferum isolates were able to cause soft rot symptoms on chicory and potato. Moreover, the symptoms on potatoes were more severe at temperatures from 15 to 37 A degrees C with P. c. subsp. odoriferum isolates than with P. atrosepticum or P. c. subsp. carotovorum isolates. Tissue maceration by P. c. subsp. odoriferum isolates was highest at 28 A degrees C, and at that temperature tissue maceration was two-times greater for P. c. subsp. odoriferum isolates than for P. c. subsp. carotovorum isolates. Symptoms on inoculated chicory leaves were more severe with P. c. subsp. odoriferum (regardless of origin) than with other subspecies or species. To our knowledge, this is the first report that P. c. subsp. odoriferum occurs on a wide range of vegetables and has the ability to cause soft rot during potato storage.

AB Potato stem canker caused by Rhizoctonia solani commonly occurs in potato-growing regions around the world, but little is known about whether binucleate Rhizoctonia (BNR) can incite this disease on potato plants in China. In the present study, a total of 69 BNR isolates were recovered from cankered subterraneous stems of potato collected from 17 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of China. Based on the morphological characteristics and sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacers of the ribosomal DNA, 48 isolates were classified as anastomosis group (AG)-A with a ratio of 69.56 %, 15 isolates (21.74 %) were AG-K, four isolates (5.80 %) were AG-F, one isolate (1.45 %) was AG-I and one isolate (1.45 %) was AG-U. Pathogenicity tests under glasshouse conditions revealed that all BNR isolates, except for the AG-I isolate, could induce symptoms of stem canker on potato plants with disease incidence ranging from 5.26 to 55.56 % and disease index ranging from 1.32 to 13.89, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed report about BNR AGs causing stem canker on potato plants in China.

AB Using a DNA-based typing method, 48 bacterial strains isolated from infected potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers originating from Kenya were characterized. The pel gene specific primers showed that all the 48 bacterial strains were pectolytic. Subspecies-specific primers EXPCCF/EXPCCR and Br1f/L1r identified 66 % of the strains as Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum while 34 % were identified as Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense based on their characteristic band sizes of 550 and 322 bp, respectively. Amplification of the 16S-23S rDNA (ITS) region did not yield observable differences in banding patterns between the Kenyan strains. However, PCR-RFLP analysis together with partial nucleotide sequences of the housekeeping mdh and gapA genes confirmed the results obtained by the specific primers. Phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated partial gene sequences grouped Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense Kenyan strains together with those identified in other parts of the world with 90 % and 99 % bootstrap support values, respectively. Pathogenicity assays using representative Kenyan strains demonstrated varied levels of tuber maceration ability. The Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense Kenyan strains were shown to be less aggressive in causing soft rot when compared to type strains. This study describes for the first time the genetic diversity of pectolytic bacteria causing soft rot disease of potatoes in Kenya.

AB The main causal agent of early blight, the noxious disease of solanaceous crops, is generally considered to be Alternaria solani Sorauer (in a broad sense). However, heterogeneity in many morphological features of this pathogen has been noted suggesting that the disease may not be caused by a single species. Recent research has revealed that several large-spored Alternaria species may cause disease of potato and tomato including A. solani sensu stricto and A. tomatophila. The goal of our research was to compare Russian large-spored Alternaria isolates from tomato and potato to test the hypothesis that early blight of tomato and potato are caused by different species. Cluster analysis of genetic distances estimated from 12 polymorphic molecular markers (universally primed-polymerase chain reaction and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA) revealed two groups of isolates accepted here as A. solani and A. tomatophila that were supported by morphology and host plant association. Differentiation of species was supported by phylogeny derived from the DNA sequences of a portion of the Alt a1, gpd and calmodulin genes. Species-specific primers based on the Alt a1 and calmodulin gene sequences for both species were designed. Under laboratory conditions, A. solani isolates were equally aggressive on both tomato and potato, whereas A. tomatophila was highly aggressive to tomato but only weakly aggressive to potato. In the field, A. solani was isolated from potato, tomato and from several wild potato species including S. schickii, S. papita and S. kurtzianum. The majority (90 %) of A. solani isolates carried the mating type locus 1 (MAT1) idiomorph MAT1-1 while the majority (88 %) of A. tomatophila isolates carried the MAT1-2 idiomorph.

AB Potato grown for early or off-season production plays a crucial role in the economy of several areas in the Mediterranean countries. Irrigation is important for determining yield and earliness, thus a better investigation of plant response under various pedo-climatic conditions can help to improve resource use efficiency and farmer income. A two-year field research (2009-2010) was carried out in Apulia region, southern Italy, on cv Spunta grown under three irrigation regimes: full irrigation (I-100), 50% of full irrigation (I-50) and rainfed (I-0). Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Plant water status, plant growth and, at harvesting, water use efficiency, yield and quality parameters were quantified. Water stress significantly affected yield response: as an average of the two years, a marketable yield decrement of 25.9 and 63.6% was observed in I-50 and rainfed compared with I-100 treatment, respectively. On the contrary, tuber dry matter and specific gravity increased moving from irrigated treatments to the rainfed one and varied also as a function of experimental year. The results confirmed that irrigation is required for early potato cultivation because rainfall is not sufficient to meet crop water needs. In addition, the study indicated that the irrigation regime reduced by 50% of crop water requirements was able to furnish satisfactory yield, with tuber quality characteristics similar or even better than those obtained under full irrigation.

AB The sweet potato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, is a highly differentiated species complex. Despite consisting of several morphologically indistinguishable entities and frequent invasions on all continents with important associated economic losses, the phylogenetic relationships, species status, and evolutionary history of this species complex is still debated. We sequenced and analyzed one mitochondrial and three single-copy nuclear genes from 9 of the 12 genetic groups of B. tabaci and 5 closely related species. Bayesian species delimitation was applied to investigate the speciation events of B. tabaci. The species statuses of the different genetic groups were strongly supported under different prior settings and phylogenetic scenarios. Divergence histories were estimated by a multispecies coalescence approach implemented in *BEAST. Based on mitochondrial locus, B. tabaci was originated 6.47 million years ago (MYA). Nevertheless, the time was 1.25 MYA based on nuclear loci. According to the method of approximate Bayesian computation, this difference is probably due to different degrees of migration among loci; i.e., although the mitochondrial locus had differentiated, gene flow at nuclear loci was still possible, a scenario similar to parapatric mode of speciation. This is the first study in whiteflies using multilocus data and incorporating Bayesian coalescence approaches, both of which provide a more biologically realistic framework for delimiting species status and delineating the divergence history of B. tabaci. Our study illustrates that gene flow during species divergence should not be overlooked and has a great impact on divergence time estimation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines support for the genetic modification (GM) of crops in the context of preventing "late blight," a devastating potato and tomato disease that caused the Irish Potato Famine in the 1850s and results in substantial crop loss today. We surveyed U.S. adults who do the primary grocery shopping in their household (n = 859). Half of the respondents were randomly assigned to read a vignette describing late blight before responding to questions about GM, whereas the other half read a vignette about generic crop disease before responding to questions. We also examine how the perceived fairness of decision makers relates to GM support and the perceived legitimacy of GM decision making. We found that disease specificity mattered less to support and legitimacy than the perceived fairness of decision makers. The perceived risks of GM to human and environmental health negatively related to GM support and legitimacy, whereas the perceived benefits (e.g. reduced threats to crops and a more secure food supply) positively related to support and legitimacy. Objective knowledge about GM had a small, negative relationship with legitimacy whereas self-assessed familiarity with GM had a positive relationship. Overall, the results offer additional confirmation of past findings from more localized settings that perceived fairness of decision makers matters to support for GM and underscore the importance of considering how risk managers' behaviors and actions are perceived alongside individuals' perceptions about the risks and benefits.

AB The aim of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of different vegetable exposure methods (variety versus single taste) over a 9 day period in two groups of infants; those introduced to solids prior to the age of 5.5 months, and those introduced after 5.5 months. Sixty parent infant dyads were recruited in South Birmingham, UK. Infants' acceptance of a novel vegetable (pea puree) was measured after a 9 day exposure period in the infants a week after they were first introduced to solid foods. During the exposure period half of each age group was given carrot every day, and the other half was given a variety pack of courgette, parsnip and sweet potato. A baseline measurement of the infants' acceptance of a vegetable (carrot) was taken prior to the exposure period. There was no difference between the groups in consumption of the baseline vegetable (carrot). There were no main effects of exposure group or age group on consumption of pea after the exposure period. There was, however, an interaction between the age of introduction and exposure group on consumption of the new vegetable (pea). In particular, infants weaned at 6 months in the single taste group ate significantly less pea puree than those in the variety group. These findings suggest that infants, who are weaned at 6 months or later, may benefit from being weaned onto a variety of tastes rapidly to ensure adequate exposure to taste. This study constitutes some of the first evidence to suggest that there may be a sensitive period for the acceptance of tastes between the ages of 4 and 6 months. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Potato processors produce large volumes of waste in the form of potato peel which is either discarded or sold at a low price. Potato peel waste is a potential source of steroidal alkaloids which are biologically active secondary metabolites which could serve as precursors to agents with apoptotic, chemopreventive and anti-inflammatory properties. The present study investigated the relative efficacy of ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) and solid liquid extraction (SLE) both using methanol, to extract steroidal alkaloids from potato peel waste and identified optimal conditions for UAE of a-solanine, a-chaconine, solanidine and demissidine. Using response surface methodology optimal UAE conditions were identified as an amplitude of 61 mu m and an extraction time of 17 min which resulted the recovery of 1102 jig steroidal alkaloids/g dried potato peel (DPP). In contrast, SLE yielded 710.51 glycoalkaloid mu g/g DPP. Recoveries of individual glycoalkoids using UAE yielded 273, 542.7, 231 and 55.3 mu g/g DPP for a-solanine, a-chaconine, solanidine and demissidine respectively. Whereas for SLE yields were 180.3, 337.6, 160.2 and 32.4 mu g/g DPP for a-solanine, a-chaconine, solanidine and demissidine respectively. The predicted values from the developed second order quadratic polynomial equation were in close agreement with the experimental values with low average mean deviation (E < 5%) values. Predicted models were highly significant (p < 0.05) for all parameters studied. This study indicates that UAE has strong potential as an extraction method for steroidal alkaloids from potato peel waste. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to use impedance spectroscopy to evaluate microstructural changes in potato tissue caused by heat treatments. Potato samples were subjected to 30 min treatments at room temperature, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 degrees C. Changes in microstructure were evaluated by texture, electrolyte leakage and color measurements, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Samples processed at 60 and 70 degrees C showed significantly different module of impedance and phase values than those processed at <= 50 degrees C. Texture decreased and electrolyte leakage increased after treating potato at temperatures above 60 degrees C, indicating loss of turgor pressure and rupture of both membranes and cell walls. Significant changes in tissue microstructure and progressive cell wall degradation as temperature increased were visualized using CLSM. Real-time nondestructive impedance spectroscopy proved to be a quantitative means of following the effects of process temperature on potato cell walls and starch, and subsequently on textural properties.

AB Development of a methodology for rapid assessment of shelf-life of fried potato wedges were carried out using electronic noses (e-noses) with metal oxide gas sensors. Fuzzy logic analysis was applied for the first time for screening the sensors and it was found that four sensors were more specific for detecting volatile organic compounds from fried potato wedges. Data obtained from these screened sensors concluded that fried potato wedges had shelf-life of 3 days when stored in inert atmosphere of nitrogen in Ziploc pouches at 23 +/- 2 degrees C. Mahalanobis distance method was adopted for quantifying the extent of spoilage and was correlated to peroxide values and free fatty acid content obtained by biochemical assays. Since, this methodology accurately and rapidly predicted the shelf-life of fried potato wedges; it could be also applied for fast and reliable estimation of shelf-life of various fried food products.

AB Blanching is an essential step before processing of agricultural products as it can inactivate enzymes that cause undesirable changes. However, the widely used traditional hot water blanching has many disadvantages such as nutrients loss during blanching and pollution caused by waste blanching water. Therefore to alleviate these problems, the traditional hot water blanching method should be replaced by new blanching technologies without using water as the thermal media. Superheated steam impingement blanching (SSIB) technology combines the advantages of superheated steam and impingement technology, resulting in a rapid, no waste water and efficient process. This paper reviews recent advances in SSIB. The equipment used for SSIB was first presented, then application of SSIB in processing agricultural products including yam slices, sweet potato, grape, sea cucumber, fresh-cut lettuce, and apple quarters were briefly outlined, and finally challenges and opportunities associated with this technology were discussed.

AB Extrusion process was developed to exploit blackcurrant juice press residues from industrial side-streams. Press residues obtained from conventional enzymatic pressing, with high content of fiber and seed oil, and novel non-enzymatic juice processing, with high content of sugars, fruit acids and anthocyanins, were extruded with barley flour, oat flour or oat bran. The recipes consisted of blackcurrant press residues (30%), cereal materials (40%) and potato starch (30%) and small amount of sugar and salt. When compared to enzymatic press residue and oat bran, the novel non-enzymatic press residue extruded with barley or oat flour had higher expansion, lower hardness and density, higher redness (a*), lower pH, and higher contents of fructose, glucose and fruit acids, all contributing positively to liking of texture, appearance, and flavor as well as berry-like experience. These characteristics were obtained with more gentle processing parameters, consisting of a lower total mass flow, screw speed and barrel temperature Female consumers gave lower ratings in flavor, appearance and overall pleasantness for blackcurrant snacks than males. The study presented a sustainable way of utilizing industrial press residues from different processes of berry juice pressing for production of healthy snacks and breakfast cereals.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of rosemary extract on the stabilisation of sunflower oil and the reduction of acrylamide formation in potato during deep-fat frying. The synthetic antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole, tertiary butylhydroquinone, and tocopherols served as positive controls. Thermo-oxidative alterations were measured according to various physical and chemical parameters. Total polar compounds, free fatty acids, conjugated dienes, conjugated trienes, and colour (L*, b*) were evaluated for effectiveness of the antioxidants to stabilise the sunflower oil. The acrylamide concentration was evaluated for effectiveness of the antioxidants to reduce the acrylamide content in the deep-fried potato. Except for the decreased L* value (darkness of oil colour), these parameters all increased with the number of frying cycles. The order of effectiveness for inhibition of sunflower oil degradation and reduction of acrylamide formation in deep-fried potato was: rosemary extract > tocopherols > tertiary butylhydroquinone > butylated hydroxyanisole > control (P < 0.05). Total polar compounds, free fatty acid and acrylamide levels were significantly correlated with frying time (P < 0.05). The acrylamide formation in fried potatoes was significantly correlated with the formation of total polar compounds (P < 0.05) in the frying oil during the frying process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of frying technique (air-frying and deep oil-frying) and type of pre-treatment (freezing and blanching) on the evolution of mechanical and optical properties of French fries. The results showed that the chromatic parameters, a* and b*, experimented an increase regardless of the frying method. The increase in a* was significantly higher in deep-oil frying as a result of Maillard's reactions. The texture analysis reported a first stage of initial softening related to starch gelatinization followed by a second stage where the maximum force increased due to the gradual formation of a crust, both stages being faster in deep-oil frying. Pre-frozen potatoes presented the highest value of maximum force parameter independent of the type of frying. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Personal values can be measured using quantitative or qualitative methods. This paper aims to investigate the attribute-consequence-value patterns collected from means-end chain analysis and to examine their relationship to personal value domains from Schwartz value theory measured through the use of the Portrait Value Questionnaire. The study was performed on two product categories, potato chips and orange juice, in which two value segments of opposing value domains were found, Conservatism and Openness to change clusters. There was consistency between means-end chain analysis results and the expected traits of the value domains. The Conservatism cluster embracing security, tradition, and conformity values sought financial security through saving money by paying more attention to price and selected familiar brands in order to avoid risks of spending extra money. The Openness to change cluster, which embraced hedonism and stimulation values, emphasized attaining pleasure and enjoyment in life through various consequences that branched out from a number of sensory product attributes. This study illustrates the compatibility between the two instruments. The use of means-end chain analysis confirmed Schwartz's definition of values as guiding behavior, and that values are ordered by relative importance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) light treatment on total soluble phenolic (TSP) contents of various whole and fresh-cut specialty crops was evaluated. Whole fruits (strawberries, blueberries, grapes), vegetables (cherry tomatoes, white sweet corn) and root crops (sweet potatoes, colored potatoes), and fresh-cut fruit, vegetables and root crops (apple wedge, iceberg lettuce, broccoli floret and stem, and sliced radish, daikon, and parsnip) were treated with increasing UV-B dose levels (1.3-5.9 kJ m(-2)) and followed by incubation to allow for the samples to respond. TSP levels were measured. The changes in TSP were species-dependent. Whole grapes, blueberries, pink and red cherry tomatoes, white sweet corn, colored potatoes and sweet potatoes did not benefit from UV-B exposure. Strawberries showed a slight, but significant increase in TSP at the highest UV-B dose. UV-B exposure did not affect TSP of apple wedge, broccoli floret and stem, sliced radish and daikon after incubation. Fresh-cut lettuce and parsnip showed significant 1.2 and 2.3 times increase, respectively, in TSP mostly due to the combination effect of wounding and UV-B light exposure after 3 d of incubation. UV-B light exposure (1.3-5.9 kJ m(-2)) can be used as an additional processing step on selected specialty crops to enhance their soluble phenolic contents. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The aim of this research was to study the effects of two hurdle technologies, citric acid application (CA) at 0.3%, 0.6% and 0.9% and thermal treatments (IT) for 1, 2 and 3 min at 50 degrees C, on the color of radish slices over 10 d of refrigerated storage. Contribution of the hurdles and their interactions were evaluated by examining the treatment effects on the following parameters: chromatic coordinates (L*, a* and b*) and the indices: chroma (Delta C*), total color difference (Delta E) and Color Index (CI*).
   The chromatic parameters for fresh radish (control samples) were L-0= 69.43 +/- 0.62, a(0)= -0.46 +/- 0.05 and b(0) = 5.37 +/- 0.37, while the calculated color indices were chroma = 5.39 +/- 0.36, Delta E = 0 and CI* = -1.19 +/- 0.17. Regarding control samples, the b* values showed an increasing trend during storage, which was associated with browning of the slices. Both Delta E and Delta C* values presented similar trends as reported for b*. Based on statistical analysis of the parameters and indices tested, the single hurdle application of low citric acid concentration (0.3%) or intermediate immersion time (2 min) at 50 degrees C minimized the radish slices color changes during storage. However, better results were obtained when two hurdles in series were applied. According to analysis, the treatment T7 (1 min IT, 0.3% CA) was selected as the best treatment to improve the retention of typical natural color of the minimally processed sliced radishes.

AB Recently the numbers of spoilage incidents in food industry by the species of Thermoascus are increasing, but the risk of food spoilage have never been evaluated.
   It became obvious that their heat-resistances were higher than those of other heat-resist fungi, Byssochlamys, Hamigera and Neosartoiya by our analyses. On the other hand, Thermoascus aurantiacus and Byssochlamys verrucosa had the idh gene, but they showed no patulin production in Potato dextrose broth or Czapek-glucose medium. Therefore, Thermoascus must be discriminated from other fungi in the food industry. We developed a rapid and highly-sensitive method of detecting Thermoascus in the genus level by using PCR. This method is expected to be extremely beneficial for the surveillance of raw materials in the food production process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The detection of bipyridine herbicides residues in food samples is hampered due to their particular physico-chemical features, which requires the application of specific extraction and analytical procedures, which disqualifies them from being incorporated into the multi-residue methods (MRMs). There is a need for alternative robust and efficient analytical screening methods, and in this respect, we present here a fast and reliable immunochemical analytical procedure for the detection of paraquat (PQ) residues in food samples, particularly potato, barley and wheat. The procedure involves the extraction with 1 N HCl:MeOH at 80 degrees C, followed by centrifugation and filtration, and the extracts can be directly measured by a microplate-based ELISA without any other sample treatment or clean-up, except from buffering the solution and adjusting the pH. Selective polyclonal antibodies, were raised against N-(4-carboxypent-1-yl)-N'-methyl bipyridilium acid (hapten PQ1), and used to establish a high sensitive immunochemical analytical assay, able to measure simultaneously many samples. Under these conditions the accuracy is very good, with almost quantitative recoveries. The non-specific interferences caused by the matrix are negligible for the case of potato and wheat, while for barley it is necessary to further dilute the extract or using a negative certified extract to build the standard calibration curve. The method of extraction consisted in acidic extraction and after a dilution is able to be measured. The analysis method results simply, achieving good detectabilities. The limits of detection CLODS) achieved were between 0.037 +/- 0.01 mu g kg(-1) in wheat, 0.71 +/- 0.3 mu g kg(-1) in barley and 0.56 +/- 0.10 mu g kg(-1) in potatoes, values that are far below the Maximum Residue Level (20 mu g kg(-1)) established by the EU policies for paraquat residues in these foodstuff products. The results demonstrate the high potential of these methods as screening tools for food safety and inspection controls. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The lack of reliable markers for the discrimination between organic and conventional products makes the organic food market susceptible to attempted fraud. Robust analytical methodologies for organic food authentication are urgently needed. In this study a new approach, compound-specific nitrogen and oxygen isotope analysis of plant-derived nitrate, has been applied alongside bulk nitrogen isotope analysis for discrimination between organically and conventionally greenhouse-grown lettuce and retail potatoes and tomatoes. The method revealed significant differences between conventional and organic fertilisation. An intra-plant isotopic variation as well as significant impact of the fertiliser application rate on the nitrogen and oxygen isotope values of plant-derived nitrate has been observed. Nitrogen and oxygen isotope analysis of nitrate has a potential for differentiation between organic and conventional crops. Further analysis is needed to improve our understanding of the scope of application and robustness of this compound-specific approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Muscodor species are sterile, volatile producing endophytic fungi with antimicrobial properties. The current study reports the new species Muscodor darjeelingensis from internal stem tissue of Cinnamomum camphora. The fungus produces white colonies over potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium with sterile ropy mycelial filaments. Scanning electron microscopy photographs showed formation of thick sterile mycelium with cauliflower-like structures. The phylogenetic analysis based on ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 confirms its identity as a new species in the genus Muscodor. The fungus also produces a unique mixture of 27 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) predominantly 2, 6-Bis (1, 1-dimethylethyl)-4-(1-oxopropyl) phenol, 1, 6-Dioxacyclododecane-7, 12-dione and 4-octadecylmorpholine. A consortium of these volatiles exhibited inhibitory effect over a tested battery of pathogenic microorganisms. Out of 25 tested pathogenic microorganisms, the VOCs inhibit the growth of five fungal pathogens by 50-70 %, while considerable inhibition was observed against Candida species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a phytopathogenic bacterium that causes crown gall disease by transferring transferred DNA (T-DNA) into the plant genome. The translocation process is mediated by the type IV secretion system (T4SS) consisting of the VirD4 coupling protein and 11 VirB proteins (VirB1 to VirB11). All VirB proteins are required for the production of T-pilus, which consists of processed VirB2 (T-pilin) and VirB5 as major and minor subunits, respectively. VirB2 is an essential component of T4SS, but the roles of VirB2 and the assembled T-pilus in Agrobacterium virulence and the T-DNA transfer process remain unknown. Here, we generated 34 VirB2 amino acid substitution variants to study the functions of VirB2 involved in VirB2 stability, extracellular VirB2/T-pilus production and virulence of A. tumefaciens. From the capacity for extracellular VirB2 production (ExB2(+) or ExB2(-)) and tumorigenesis on tomato stems (Vir(+) or Vir(-)), the mutants could be classified into three groups: ExB2(-)/Vir(-), ExB2(-)/Vir(+), and ExB2(+)/Vir(+). We also confirmed by electron microscopy that five ExB2(-)/Vir(+) mutants exhibited a wild-type level of virulence with their deficiency in T-pilus formation. Interestingly, although the five T-pilus(-)/Vir(+) uncoupling mutants retained a wild-type level of tumorigenesis efficiency on tomato stems and/or potato tuber discs, their transient transformation efficiency in Arabidopsis seedlings was highly attenuated. In conclusion, we have provided evidence for a role of T-pilus in Agrobacterium transformation process and have identified the domains and amino acid residues critical for VirB2 stability, T-pilus biogenesis, tumorigenesis, and transient transformation efficiency.

AB In this study, interactions of dichromate ions with potato starch granules in highly acidic aqueous solutions and at different temperatures were investigated. It was found that the process underwent a reduction of Cr2O72- to Cr3+ accompanied by the formation of intermediate Cr5+ ions detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The reactions took place after the attachment of dichromate anions to the granules and resulted in a lowering of the Cr2O72- initial content in the solution. The newly formed Cr3+ ions were both accumulated by the granules or remained in the solution. It was observed for the first time that the quantity of such ions taken by the granules from the solution was noticeably higher than that delivered by trivalent chromium salt solution. It was revealed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) that the chromium ions were not only adsorbed on the granule surface but also introduced into the granule interior and evenly distributed there. An activation energy of the reduction reaction equal to 65 kJ.mol(-1) and the optimal parameters of the process were established. The proposed mechanism could be useful for the bioremediation of industrial effluents polluted by hexavalent chromium compounds.

AB Background: Suberin is a recalcitrant plant biopolymer composed of a polyphenolic and a polyaliphatic domain. Although suberin contributes to a significant portion of soil organic matter, the biological process of suberin degradation is poorly characterized. It has been suggested that Streptomyces scabiei, a plant pathogenic bacterium, can produce suberin-degrading enzymes. In this study, a comparative analysis of the S. scabiei secretome from culture media supplemented or not with potato suberin was carried out to identify enzymes that could be involved in suberin degradation.
   Methods: S. scabiei was grown in the presence of casein only or in the presence of both casein and suberin. Extracellular proteins from 1-, 3- and 5-day-old supernatants were analyzed by LC-MS/MS to determine their putative functions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to monitor the expression level of genes encoding several proteins potentially involved in suberin degradation.
   Results: The effect of suberin on the extracellular protein profile of S. scabiei strain has been analyzed. A total of 246 proteins were found to be common in the data sets from both casein medium (CM) and casein-suberin medium (CSM), whereas 124 and 139 proteins were detected only in CM or CSM, respectively. The identified proteins could be divided into 19 functional groups. Two functional groups of proteins (degradation of aromatic compounds and secondary metabolism) were only associated with the CSM. A high proportion of the proteins found to be either exclusively produced, or overproduced, in presence of suberin were involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Most of the proteins included in the lipid metabolism class have been detected in CSM. Apart from lipid metabolism proteins, other identified proteins, particularly two feruloyl esterases, may also actively participate in the breakdown of suberin architecture. Both feruloyl esterase genes were overexpressed between 30 to 340 times in the presence of suberin.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the presence of suberin in S. scabiei growth medium induced the production of a wide variety of glycosyl hydrolases. Furthermore, this study has allowed the identification of extracellular enzymes that could be involved in the degradation of suberin, including enzymes of the lipid metabolism and feruloyl esterases.

AB Despite the seemingly continuous development of newer and ever more elaborate methods for detecting and identifying viruses, very few of these new methods get adopted for routine use in testing laboratories, often despite the many and varied claimed advantages they possess. To understand why the rate of uptake of new technologies is so low, requires a strong understanding of what makes a good routine diagnostic tool to begin. This can be done by looking at the two most successfully established plant virus detection methods: enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and more recently introduced real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). By examining the characteristics of this pair of technologies, it becomes clear that they share many benefits, such as an industry standard format and high levels of repeatability and reproducibility. These combine to make methods that are accessible to testing labs, which are easy to establish and robust in their use, even with new and inexperienced users. Hence, to ensure the establishment of new techniques it is necessary to not only provide benefits not found with ELISA or real-time PCR, but also to provide a platform that is easy to establish and use. In plant virus diagnostics, recent developments can be clustered into three core areas: (1) techniques that can be performed in the field or resource poor locations (e.g., loop-mediated isothermal amplification LAMP); (2) multiplex methods that are able to detect many viruses in a single test (e.g., Luminex bead arrays); and (3) methods suited to virus discovery (e.g., next generation sequencing, NGS). Field based methods are not new, with Lateral Flow Devices (LFDs) for the detection being available for a number of years now. However, the widespread uptake of this technology remains poor. LAMP does offer significant advantages over LFDs, in terms of sensitivity and generic application, but still faces challenges in terms of establishment. It is likely that the main barrier to the uptake of field-based technologies is behavioural influences, rather than specific concerns about the performance of the technologies themselves. To overcome this, a new relationship will need to develop between centralised testing laboratories offering services and those requiring tests; a relationship which is currently in its infancy. Looking further into the future, virus discovery and multiplex methods seem to converge as NGS becomes ever cheaper, easier to perform and can provide high levels of multiplexing without the use of virus specific reagents. So ultimately the key challenge from a routine testing lab perspective will not be one of investment in platforms which could even be outsourced to commercial sequencing services but one of having the skills and expertise to analyse the large datasets generated and their subsequent interpretation. In conclusion, only time will tell which of the next-generation of methods currently in development will become the routine diagnostics of the future. This will be determined through a combination of factors. And while the technology itself will have to offer performance advantages over existing methods in order to supplant them, it is likely to be human factors e.g., the behaviours of end users, laboratories and policy makers, the availability of appropriate expertise, that ultimately determine which ones become established. Hence factors cannot be ignored and early engagement with diagnostic stakeholders is essential. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pathogens and their vectors can interact either directly or indirectly via their shared hosts, with implications for the persistence and spread of the pathogen in host populations. For example, some plant viruses induce changes in host plants that cause the aphids that carry these viruses to settle preferentially on infected plants. Furthermore, relative preference by the vector for infected plants can change to a preference for noninfected plants after virus acquisition by the vector, as has recently been demonstrated in the wheat-Rhopalosiphum padi-Barley yellow dwarf virus pathosystem. Here we document a similar dynamic in the potato-Myzus persicae (Sulzer)-Potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) pathosystem. Specifically, in a dual choice bioassay, nonviruliferous apterous M. persicae settled preferentially on or near potato plants infected with PLRV relative to noninfected (sham-inoculated) control plants, whereas viruliferous M. persicae (carrying PLRV) preferentially settled on or near sham-inoculated potato plants relative to infected plants. The change in preference after virus acquisition also occurred in response to trapped headspace volatiles, and to synthetic mimics of headspace volatile blends from PLRV-infected and sham-inoculated potato plants. The change in preference we document should promote virus spread by increasing rates of virus acquisition and transmission by the vector. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   TRANSMISSION; GENE-EXPRESSION; SALIVARY-GLANDS; SARDINIA-VIRUS
AB Begomoviruses are a group of icosahedral single stranded DNA viruses exclusively transmitted by the sweet potato whitefly Bemisia tabaci in a persistent, circulative manner. In this mode of transmission, begomoviruses are acquired by their insect vector as intact virions from the plant phloem, move along the food canal, foregut and esophagus and reach the midgut where they are absorbed into the hemolymph via the filter chamber. The filter chamber is the site where most of the ingested food is filtered, and the first site where the majority of begomoviruses appear to be translocated into the hemolymph via unknown proteins or receptors. Transport from the filter chamber to the hemolymph is aided by a Heat Shock Protein 70. Virus particles not translocated across the filter chamber circulate in the midgut loop but it is not known whether absorption into the hemolymph occurs along this loop. Localization studies have confirmed that begomoviruses are not associated with the hindgut and absorption of virions in this organ is unlikely. In the hemolymph, virions have been shown to interact with a GroEL chaperone produced by the whitefly's endosymbiontic bacteria for ensuring their safe journey to the salivary glands. Virions penetrate the primary salivary glands via unknown proteins or receptors and are transported and secreted outside the whitefly to the plant with salivary secretions. Several recent studies have demonstrated the implications of insect and endosymbiont proteins such as the heat shock protein 70 and the bacterial GroEL protein, in the transmission of begomoviruses by B. tabaci. Additional studies attempting to identify other proteins that aid or interact with begomoviruses along their circulation pathway in the whitefly are reviewed in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the Americas, different disease symptoms have been reported in cassava including leaf mosaics, vein clearings, mottles, ring spots, leaf distortions and undeveloped and deformed storage roots. Some viruses have been identified and associated with these symptoms while others have been reported in symptomless plants or latent infections. We observed that reoviruses associated with severe root symptoms (RS) of Cassava Frogskin Disease (CFSD) are not associated with leaf symptoms (LS) observed in the cassava indicator plant 'Secundina'. Neither were these LS associated with the previously characterized Cassava common mosaic virus, Cassava virus X, Cassava vein mosaic virus or phytoplasma, suggesting the presence of additional pathogens. In order to explain LS observed in cassava we used a combination of biological, serological and molecular tests. Here, we report three newly described viruses belonging to the families Secoviridae, Alphaflexiviridae and Luteoviridae found in cassava plants showing severe RS associated with CFSD. All tested plants were infected by a mix of viruses that induced distinct LS in 'Secundina'. Out of the three newly described viruses, a member of family Secoviridae could experimentally induce LS in single infection. Our results confirm the common occurrence of complex viral infections in cassava field-collected since the 1980s. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Asymptomatic field plants are the normal source of the vine cuttings used as sweetpotato planting material in Africa. Previous and new tests of such East African material, mostly using the very sensitive method of graft inoculation to the indicator plant Ipomoea setosa, showed that a majority tested virus-negative. This was despite their never having undergone any science-based therapy. To investigate how this occurs, in a replicated greenhouse experiment, plants of susceptible cultivars from the USA and Peru and three resistant Ugandan cultivars were graft-inoculated with Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV), the commonest virus infecting sweetpotato. When the grafts were established, cuttings were taken, rooted and proved to be infected. The health status of each of these new plants was then followed over a 10-week period using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Most of the plants of the Ugandan cultivars eventually tested SPFMV-negative whereas those of the USA and Peru seldom did. Furthermore, in subsequent graft-inoculations of scions from the tip, top, middle and base of the vine of every plant to I. setosa plants, again, most of the scions of the Ugandan cultivars tested SPFMV-negative whereas those of the USA and Peru seldom did. These tests demonstrate the phenomenon of reversion in the Ugandan cultivars and can explain how most unprotected Ugandan sweetpotato field plants tested SPFMV-negative. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Four tobacco rattle virus (TRV) isolates were identified from tobacco bait seedlings planted in soil samples from Polish potato fields. Sequence analysis of the genomic RNA1 of the isolates revealed significant similarity to the isolates Ho and AL recently found in Germany. Multiple sequence alignments of the genomic RNA2 indicated that the two isolates from northern Poland (Deb57 and Slu24) are in a cluster with the isolates PSG and PLB found in the Netherlands. The remaining two isolates, from central Poland (11r21 and Mlo7), are in a distinct group with the unique isolate SYM found in England. The RNA2 sequences of the studied isolates range from 1998 nt to 2739 nt in length, and all carry deletions of the 26 and/or 2c genes. The isolate Mlo7 has an atypical RNA2 structure, having its cp gene located in its central region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Highly diverse communities of bacteria inhabiting soybean rhizospheres play pivotal roles in plant growth and crop production; however, little is known about the changes that occur in these communities during growth. We used both culture-dependent physiological profiling and culture independent DNA-based approaches to characterize the bacterial communities of the soybean rhizosphere during growth in the field. The physiological properties of the bacterial communities were analyzed by a community-level substrate utilization assay with BioLog Eco plates, and the composition of the communities was assessed by gene pyrosequencing. Higher metabolic capabilities were found in rhizosphere soil than in bulk soil during all stages of the BioLog assay. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that differences between the bacterial communities of rhizosphere and bulk soils at the phylum level; i.e., Proteobacteria were increased, while Acidobacteria and Firmicutes were decreased in rhizosphere soil during growth. Analysis of operational taxonomic units showed that the bacterial communities of the rhizosphere changed significantly during growth, with a higher abundance of potential plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, including Bacillus, Bradyrhizobium, and Rhizobium, in a stage-specific manner.

AB Background: To combat infection to biotic stress plants elicit the biosynthesis of numerous natural products, many of which are valuable pharmaceutical compounds. Jasmonate is a central regulator of defense response to pathogens and accumulation of specialized metabolites. Catharanthus roseus produces a large number of terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) and is an excellent model for understanding the regulation of this class of valuable compounds. Recent work illustrates a possible role for the Catharanthus WRKY transcription factors (TFs) in regulating TIA biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis and other plants, the WRKY TF family is also shown to play important role in controlling tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as secondary metabolism.
   Results: Here, we describe the WRKY TF families in response to jasmonate in Arabidopsis and Catharanthus. Publically available Arabidopsis microarrays revealed at least 30% (22 of 72) of WRKY TFs respond to jasmonate treatments. Microarray analysis identified at least six jasmonate responsive Arabidopsis WRKY genes (AtWRKY7, AtWRKY20, AtWRKY26, AtWRKY45, AtWRKY48, and AtWRKY72) that have not been previously reported. The Catharanthus WRKY TF family is comprised of at least 48 members. Phylogenetic clustering reveals 11 group I, 32 group II, and 5 group III WRKY TFs. Furthermore, we found that at least 25% (12 of 48) were jasmonate responsive, and 75% (9 of 12) of the jasmonate responsive CrWRKYs are orthologs of AtWRKYs known to be regulated by jasmonate.
   Conclusion: Overall, the CrWRKY family, ascertained from transcriptome sequences, contains approximately 75% of the number of WRKYs found in other sequenced asterid species (pepper, tomato, potato, and bladderwort). Microarray and transcriptomic data indicate that expression of WRKY TFs in Arabidopsis and Catharanthus are under tight spatio-temporal and developmental control, and potentially have a significant role in jasmonate signaling. Profiling of CrWRKY expression in response to jasmonate treatment revealed potential associations with secondary metabolism. This study provides a foundation for further characterization of WRKY TFs in jasmonate responses and regulation of natural product biosynthesis.

AB Background: In order to get global molecular understanding of one of the most important crop diseases worldwide, we investigated compatible and incompatible interactions between Phytophthora infestans and potato (Solanum tuberosum). We used the two most field-resistant potato clones under Swedish growing conditions, which have the greatest known local diversity of P. infestans populations, and a reference compatible cultivar.
   Results: Quantitative label-free proteomics of 51 apoplastic secretome samples (PXD000435) in combination with genome-wide transcript analysis by 42 microarrays (E-MTAB-1515) were used to capture changes in protein abundance and gene expression at 6, 24 and 72 hours after inoculation with P. infestans. To aid mass spectrometry analysis we generated cultivar-specific RNA-seq data (E-MTAB-1712), which increased peptide identifications by 17%. Components induced only during incompatible interactions, which are candidates for hypersensitive response initiation, include a Kunitz-like protease inhibitor, transcription factors and an RCR3-like protein. More secreted proteins had lower abundance in the compatible interaction compared to the incompatible interactions. Based on this observation and because the well-characterized effector-target C14 protease follows this pattern, we suggest 40 putative effector targets.
   Conclusions: In summary, over 17000 transcripts and 1000 secreted proteins changed in abundance in at least one time point, illustrating the dynamics of plant responses to a hemibiotroph. Half of the differentially abundant proteins showed a corresponding change at the transcript level. Many putative hypersensitive and effector-target proteins were single representatives of large gene families.

AB Fluorescent galactolipid analogues (1, 1a, and 2) have been synthesized with a pyrene group attached to the amino-terminal of a hexanoyl chain bound to an otherwise normal galactolipid structure. The synthetic lipids are obtained from peracetyl galactose by a general and versatile procedure based on the trichloroacetimidate methodology. The intense violet fluorescence (376 and 395 nm) and good photostability of pyrene make these compounds highly suitable as probes to study galactolipid metabolism. As proof of concept, we report that compound 2 is a valid tool to detect galactolipase activity in enzymatic preparations of potato tubers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phytophthora infestans is a destructive plant pathogen best known for causing the disease that triggered the Irish potato famine and remains the most costly potato pathogen to manage worldwide. Identification of P. infestan's elusive center of origin is critical to understanding the mechanisms of repeated global emergence of this pathogen. There are two competing theories, placing the origin in either South America or in central Mexico, both of which are centers of diversity of Solanum host plants. To test these competing hypotheses, we conducted detailed phylogeographic and approximate Bayesian computation analyses, which are suitable approaches to unraveling complex demographic histories. Our analyses used microsatellite markers and sequences of four nuclear genes sampled from populations in the Andes, Mexico, and elsewhere. To infer the ancestral state, we included the closest known relatives Phytophthora phaseoli, Phytophthora mirabilis, and Phytophthora ipomoeae, as well as the interspecific hybrid Phytophthora andina. We did not find support for an Andean origin of P. infestans; rather, the sequence data suggest a Mexican origin. Our findings support the hypothesis that populations found in the Andes are descendants of the Mexican populations and reconcile previous findings of ancestral variation in the Andes. Although centers of origin are well documented as centers of evolution and diversity for numerous crop plants, the number of plant pathogens with a known geographic origin are limited. This work has important implications for our understanding of the coevolution of hosts and pathogens, as well as the harnessing of plant disease resistance to manage late blight.

AB Aphids are sap-feeding plant pests and harbor the endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola, which is essential for their fecundity and survival. During plant penetration and feeding, aphids secrete saliva that contains proteins predicted to alter plant defenses and metabolism. Plants recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns and induce pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). No aphid-associated molecular pattern has yet been identified. By mass spectrometry, we identified in saliva from potato aphids (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) 105 proteins, some of which originated from Buchnera, including the chaperonin GroEL. Because GroEL is a widely conserved bacterial protein with an essential function, we tested its role in PTI. Applying or infiltrating GroEL onto Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves induced oxidative burst and expression of PTI early marker genes. These GroEL-induced defense responses required the known coreceptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1. In addition, in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, inducible expression of groEL activated PTI marker gene expression. Moreover, Arabidopsis plants expressing groEL displayed reduced fecundity of the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), indicating enhanced resistance against aphids. Furthermore, delivery of GroEL into tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) or Arabidopsis through Pseudomonas fluorescens, engineered to express the type III secretion system, also reduced potato aphid and green peach aphid fecundity, respectively. Collectively our data indicate that GroEL is a molecular pattern that triggers PTI.

AB The properties of a paper sheet depend on the absorption together with the physico-chemical properties of additives used in the paper processing. The effect of ionic strength and degree of substitution of cationic potato starch on the elution pattern of asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation was analysed. The effect of starch derivatisation, in either dry or wet phase, was also investigated. Average molar mass showed no difference between the starches obtained from the two derivatisation processes. Apparent densities showed that dry cationic starch had higher density than wet cationic starch for a hydrodynamic radius between 50 and 100 nm. Elution times of native and three cationic starches increased when the ionic strength increased from 50 to 100 mM. No differences in the molar mass among cationic starches with different degree of substitution suggested no degradation due to a derivatisation process. Large sample loads can be used at 100 mM without overloading. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fed-batch fermentation was used for biomass and fungal chitosan production by Aspergillus terreus (BCRC 32068) grown in a potato dextrose agar medium. The polysaccharides were extracted by an alkali-acid treatment, and structural investigations by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared analysis, and viscosity and thermal analysis were done. A high level of chitosan was extracted from A. terreus; this implied that it was feasible to produce chitosan from industrial waste mycelia. Fungal chitosan derived from A. terreus showed the highest adsorption capacity for Sn(II). The order of Sn(II) adsorption capacity for these chitosanaceous materials was Fungal chitosan>Chitin>Biomass. Fungal chitosan derived from A. terreus was well correlated with Langmuir's isotherm model. The maximum capacity for Sn(II) sorption deduced from the use of the Langmuir isotherm equation was 303 mg/g; this was significantly higher than that of A. terreus. Fungal chitosan is an easy and cost-effective material for the abatement of pollution. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2014, 131, 40436.

AB The OPUS (Optimal well-being, development and health for Danish children through a healthy New Nordic Diet (NND)) School Meal Study investigated the effects on the intake of foods and nutrients of introducing school meals based on the principles of the NND covering lunch and all snacks during the school day in a cluster-randomised cross-over design. For two 3-month periods, 834 Danish children aged 8-11 years from forty-six school classes at nine schools received NND school meals or their usual packed lunches brought from home (control) in random order. The whole diet of the children was recorded over seven consecutive days using a validated Web-based Dietary Assessment Software for Children. The NND resulted in higher intakes of potatoes (130%, 95% CI 2.07, 2.58), fish (48%, 95% CI 1.33, 1.65), cheese (25%, 95% CI 1.15, 1.36), vegetables (16%, 95% CI 1.10, 1.21), eggs (10%, 95% CI 1.01, 1.19) and beverages (6%, 95% CI 1.02, 1.09), and lower intakes of bread (13%, 95% CI 0.84, 0.89) and fats (6%, 95% CI 0.90, 0.98) were found among the children during the NND period than in the control period (all, P<0.05). No difference was found in mean energy intake (P=0.4), but on average children reported 0.9% less energy intake from fat and 0.9% higher energy intake from protein during the NND period than in the control period. For micronutrient intakes, the largest differences were found for vitamin D (42%, 95% CI 1.32, 1.53) and iodine (11%, 95% CI 1.08, 1.15) due to the higher fish intake. In conclusion, the present study showed that the overall dietary intake at the food and nutrient levels was improved among children aged 8-11 years when their habitual packed lunches were replaced by school meals following the principles of the NND.

AB The intake of carbohydrates has been evaluated cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally in an ageing American adult population. The aim of the present study was to examine trends in the intake of dietary carbohydrates and their major food sources among the Framingham Heart Study Offspring (FOS) cohort, which had been uniquely tracked for 17 years in the study. The FOS cohort was recruited in 1971-1975. Follow-up examinations were conducted, on average, every 4 years. Dietary data collection began in 1991 (examination 5) using a validated semi-quantitative FFQ. The study included 2894 adults aged 25 years with complete dietary data in at least three examinations from 1991 to 2008. Descriptive statistics were generated using SAS version 9.3, and a repeated-measures model was used to examine trends in the intake of carbohydrates and their food sources in the whole sample, and by sex and BMI category. Over 17 years of follow-up, the percentage of energy from total carbohydrates (51<bold>0</bold>-46<bold>8</bold>%; P for trend<0<bold>001</bold>) and total sugars (18<bold>2</bold>-16<bold>6</bold>%; P for trend<0<bold>001</bold>) decreased. There was a decrease in the percentage of energy from fructose (5<bold>4</bold>-4<bold>7</bold>%; P for trend<0<bold>001</bold>) and sucrose (9<bold>8</bold>-8<bold>8</bold>%; P for trend<0<bold>001</bold>). Dietary fibre intake increased (18<bold>0</bold>-19<bold>2</bold>g/d; P for trend<0<bold>001</bold>). The number of weekly servings of yeast bread, soft drinks/soda, cakes/cookies/quick breads/doughnuts, potatoes, milk, pasta, rice and cooked grains, fruit juice/drinks, potato chips/maize chips/popcorn, and lunch foods (e.g. pizzas and burgers) decreased significantly (P for trend<0<bold>001</bold>), while the intake of ready-to-eat cereals, legumes, fruits, dairy products, candy and ice cream/sherbet/frozen yogurt increased significantly (P for trend<0<bold>04</bold>). Similar trends were observed when the analyses were stratified by sex and BMI. The present results suggest favourable trends in dietary carbohydrate consumption, but dietary guidelines for fruits, vegetables and fibre were not met in this cohort.

AB Background: Viral diseases are the second most significant biotic stress for sweet potato, with yield losses reaching 20% to 40%. Over 30 viruses have been reported to infect sweet potato around the world, and 11 of these have been detected in China. Most of these viruses were detected by traditional detection approaches that show disadvantages in detection throughput. Next-generation sequencing technology provides a novel, high sensitive method for virus detection and diagnosis.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We report the polyadenylated RNA virome of three sweet potato cultivars using a high throughput RNA sequencing approach. Transcripts of 15 different viruses were detected, 11 of which were detected in cultivar Xushu18, whilst 11 and 4 viruses were detected in Guangshu 87 and Jingshu 6, respectively. Four were detected in sweet potato for the first time, and 4 were found for the first time in China. The most prevalent virus was SPFMV, which constituted 88% of the total viral sequence reads. Virus transcripts with extremely low expression levels were also detected, such as transcripts of SPLCV, CMV and CymMV. Digital gene expression (DGE) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses showed that the highest viral transcript expression levels were found in fibrous and tuberous roots, which suggest that these tissues should be optimum samples for virus detection.
   Conclusions/Significance: A total of 15 viruses were presumed to present in three sweet potato cultivars growing in China. This is the first insight into the sweet potato polyadenylated RNA virome. These results can serve as a basis for further work to investigate whether some of the 'new' viruses infecting sweet potato are pathogenic.

AB A 2-year field experiment was conducted to assess system productivity, nutrient use efficiency and apparent balances of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in diversified rice-based cropping systems at Gazipur, Bangladesh. Four cropping systems: wheat-fallow-rice, maize-fallow-rice, potato-fallow-rice and mustard-fallow-rice in main plots and four nutrient combinations: NPK, NK, NP and PK in sub-plots were arranged in a split-plot design with three replications. Receiving the NPK treatment, all the component crops gave the highest yield, and omission of N from fertilizer package gave the lowest yield. The maize-rice system removed the highest amount of N (217kgha(-1)), P (41kgha(-1)) and K (227kgha(-1)) followed by wheat-rice, potato-rice and the least in mustard-rice system. The wheat-rice and maize-rice system showed negative K balance of -35.5 and -60.4kgha(-1) in NPK treatment, while potato-rice system showed a positive K balance of 31.0kgha(-1) with NPK treatment. The N, P and K uptake and apparent recovery by the test crops may be used for site-specific nutrient management. The K rates for fertilizer recommendation in wheat and maize in Indo-Gangetic plain need to be revised to take account for the negative K balance in soil.

AB Common food preservative agents were evaluated in in vitro tests for their antifungal activity against Monilinia fructicola, the most economically important pathogen causing postharvest disease of stone fruits. Radial mycelial growth was measured in Petri dishes of PDA amended with three different concentrations of the agents (0.01-0.2%, v/v) after 7 days of incubation at 25 degrees C. Thirteen out of fifteen agents tested completely inhibited the radial growth of the fungus at various concentrations. Among them, ammonium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate and sodium bicarbonate were the most effective while sodium acetate and sodium formate were the least effective. The effective agents and concentrations were tested as ingredients of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)-lipid edible coatings against brown rot disease on plums previously inoculated with M. fructicola (curative activity). 'Friar' and 'Larry Ann' plums were inoculated with the pathogen, coated with stable edible coatings about 24 h later, and incubated at 20 degrees C and 90% RH. Disease incidence (%) and severity (lesion diameter) were determined after 4, 6, and 8 days of incubation and the 'area under the disease progress stairs' (AUDPS) was calculated. Coatings containing bicarbonates and parabens significantly reduced brown rot incidence in plums, but potassium sorbate, used at 1.0% in the coating formulation, was the most effective agent with a reduction rate of 28.6%. All the tested coatings reduced disease severity to some extent, but coatings containing 0.1% sodium methylparaben or sodium ethylparaben or 0.2% ammonium carbonate or ammonium bicarbonate were superior to the rest, with reduction rates of 45-50%. Overall, the results showed that most of the agents tested in this study had significant antimicrobial activity against M. fructicola and the application of selected antifungal edible coatings is a promising alternative for the control of postharvest brown rot in plums.

AB The relationship between the severity of natural freezing and frost damage (FFD) and the observed growth recovery and field production of Superior potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) was investigated under screen house conditions. Potato plants were damaged by accidental freezing and frost during the early phase of shoot growth, 40 days after planting in highland summer crop areas in Korea. The observations of FFD were classified visually into "severe" (>75%), "moderate" (50%), "mild" (<25%), and "no FFD", based on the percentage of the area of the shoots which was damaged. The early vegetative growth recovery, in terms of groundcover, was reduced as the level of FFD increased. At 28 days after a freezing and frost damage (DAFF), the potato plants with mild or no symptoms had produced more groundcover than the plants with moderate or severe symptoms. At 35 DAFF, groundcover was the same across all levels of severity, at nearly 100%. Despite the slower canopy development, plants with FFD achieved a higher fresh shoot weight and total chlorophyll content, whereas physiological growth indices such as photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance of leaves were not different among levels of FFD at 60 DAFF. The number of lateral stems and days to tuberization increased significantly as the level of FFD increased; however, the harvest index, the number of tubers per plant, and seed tuber production were all reduced in plants with severe FFD. In addition, the tubers from plants with severe FFD had an increased ratio of length to width and 40% more tuber eyes than tubers from undamaged plants. The elongated tubers also showed an increase in cell division, demonstrated by higher numbers of cells in the cortical zones. The aforementioned measurements were obtained from natural event and led to a deduction that Superior has a capacity to recover from FFD, unless the plants were severely damaged (>75%) early in the season.

AB Wild and cultivated potatoes form a polyploid series with 2n = 2x to 2n = 6x (x = 12). In nature, they are separated by external and/or internal hybridization barriers that, when incomplete, provide opportunities for gene flow and introgression. Isolation distances estimated in one environment are not necessary extrapolable. As a starting point for pollen-mediated gene flow risk assessment in potatoes, an experiment was set up in the field in one of the major potato growing area in Argentina, with two pollen-pistil compatible tetraploid commercial cultivars with differential molecular marker patterns. The field design consisted of a 10 x 10 m central square with the pollen donor, surrounded by circles with a male sterile pollen recipient, set every 10 m up to 40 m. The crop was managed as a perennial, and data were recorded over 2 years. Seeded berries were obtained in both years at 30 and 40 m away from the center; all of them contained hybrid seeds as revealed by electrophoretic profiles. We consider that a minimal required isolation distance of 100 m or more would be more suitable for preventing undesirable gene flow in the area.

AB Foliar applications of the synthetic auxin compound 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) have been used to enhance skin color of red potato cultivars for many years. Relatively, little is known about the mode of action of this compound, but it has been proposed that 2,4-D stimulates ethylene production and enhances the activity of enzymes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. The objective of this study was to compare several other plant growth regulators to 2,4-D for their effect on plant growth, tuber yield, and skin color of the light red-skinned cultivar "Red Lasoda." Trials were conducted in 2010 and 2011 to evaluate the effects of foliar applications of the ethylene-stimulating growth regulator ethephon, the ethylene-inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), and 2,4-D. Manual inflorescence removal was also included as a treatment to determine the influence of anthocyanin sink competition between tubers and flowers on tuber skin color. Ethephon application caused floral abscission in treated plants and reduced plant height compared to other treatments and the non-treated control. While 2,4-D caused foliar injury and ethephon slightly increased the yield of < 56 g tubers, neither growth regulator affected total and marketable yield. Both ethephon and 2,4-D increased tuber skin color at harvest compared to the non-treated control. In contrast, 1-MCP and inflorescence removal had no effect on yield, tuber size, and skin color. The results indicate that ethephon and 2,4-D foliar applications have similar effects on skin color and appearance, supporting the hypothesis that 2,4-D works by stimulating ethylene production within the plant.

AB One mechanism for plant defense is the production of proteinaceous inhibitors that block the function of pathogen-produced cell wall-modifying enzymes. The xyloglucanase-specific endoglucanase inhibitor protein (XEGIP) is proposed to exist principally to block pathogen family 12 xyloglucan-specific endoglucanases. The role of XEGIP in plant defense was tested by generating transgenic XEGIP-overexpressing potato plants. Overexpression of an endogenous XEGIP in potato resulted in major changes in plant phenotype. Short petioles, small, thick leaves, reduced root formation, and distorted tuber shape resulted from XEGIP overexpression. Susceptibility to late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, was not altered. For the XEGIP tested (AY321357), there are previously unreported alterations in plant development that can be attributed to constitutive expression of XEGIP. The principal role of at least this XEGIP may be regulation of plant-encoded enzymes.

AB A two-step method was developed to evaluate potato resistance to black scurf caused by Rhizoctonia solani. Tuber piece inoculum was first conducted in the laboratory, which was also first reported in this study. After inoculation with pathogen discs and culture for 48 h, the necrotic spots on the inoculated potato pieces were generated and measured by the crossing method. Further evaluation was conducted through field experiments using a wheat bran inoculum method. The wheat bran inoculum was placed into the pit dispersedly and surrounded seed tubers. Each cultivar or line was subjected to five treatments of 0-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-g soil inoculum. The results showed that 2-4 g of wheat bran inoculum was the optimum for identifying tuber black scurf resistance. The laboratory scores positively correlated with the incidence and severity of black scurf in the field. According to the results in the laboratory, relatively resistant cultivars could be selected for further estimation of -tuber black scurf resistance in field experiments. It is a practical and effective screening method for rapid identification of resistant potato germplasm, which can reduce workload in the field, shorten time required for identification.
